range of the OpenCPN Plugins is quite remarkable. Users should appreciate the time these authors spent to create this resource. There is a very healthy collaboration, so that at times it is impossible to determine “whose” plugin it is. Since this is one of the major strengths of Open Source we will not attribute here. However, it should be noted that there are a number of authors who are quite prolific. As the authors come to mind they will be noted below. If you are one of the authors and your name does not appear, please advise. Sean Depagnier, Dave Register, Pavel Kalian, Alec Leamas, Jean Pierre Pitzef, Dave Cowell, Dirk Smits, Jon Gough, Mike Rossiter, Salty Paws, Transmitter Dan, Peter Tulp, Konni, Hakan, Wally Schulpen, Kees Verruijt, Douwe Fokkema, Dave Deller, Rick Gleason and there are more. Many thanks to those who spent many hours helping the authors of these plugins test and debug. A special thanks to the people who have assisted by making translations for the plugin dialogs.","title":"Main Plugins","component":"manuals","version":"","name":"index-main","url":"/manuals/plugins/index-main.html","titles":[{"text":"Plugin Categories","hash":"_plugin_categories","id":1},{"text":"Click on a link above to see the plugin manual","hash":"_click_on_a_link_above_to_see_the_plugin_manual","id":2},{"text":"Plugin Authors Credit","hash":"_plugin_authors_credit","id":3},{"text":"Programmers","hash":"_programmers","id":4},{"text":"Testers/Translators","hash":"_testerstranslators","id":5}]},"4":{"id":4,"text":"General and Supplementary information Main Plugins (by Category) Main plugins are stable plugins that have been well tested.

However, more complicated plugins might need to consider the more complete list available in the installer documentation. The plugin api reference is changed from opencpn_plugin_110 to opencpn_plugin_116. GetPluginDataDir() is used instead of *GetpSharedDataLocation(). A plugin is related to two different data directories: The installation directory, handled by the installer. This is a read-only directory preloaded with data from the plugin. It is owned by the installer and plugin must not change this data. The path is retrieved using GetPluginDataDir(). The plugin’s private data directory. This is a directory created within the configuration directory, used for persistent plugin data. The base directory is retrieved using getpPrivateApplicationDataLocation() See the installer docs to see the actual paths for these directories on different platforms. There has been multiple bugs related to plugins which have been writing data into the installation directory. Such usage must be patched to work properly with the installer.

This library implements a basic observable pattern. All new-style drivers are named like comm-drv-\\*. These handles the low-level communication details. Incoming messages from the outside are made available on the navigation messages bus. Both core parts and plugins listens to this bus, acting on messages when they arrive. These messages are of type`ǸavMsg` defined in comm_navmsg.h. This is a unified, common type for all sorts of messages including NMEA2000, NMEA0183 and SignalK. In the core, comm_decoder acts as a dispatcher which listens to the message bus and invokes various parts when messages arrives. comm_decoder also handles priorities when receiving the same data from multiple sources, selecting the data source to use. For plugins, a simplified API is available, see the Plugins Communications API. When sending messages, upper layers needs to know which driver to use. To that end, drivers registers themselves in the drv_registry which maintains an actual list of available drivers.","title":"Communications Overview","component":"ocpn-dev-manual","version":"0.1","name":"comm-overview","url":"/ocpn-dev-manual/0.1/comm-overview.html","titles":[]},"11":{"id":11,"text":"Revised: 11:00, 3 October 2019 Download Xcode_11.xip from the Apple Developer website (https://developer.apple.com/download/more/) - requires registration (free) at developer.apple.com website.

Unzip and install Command_Line_Tools_for_Xcode_11 The OpenCPN official build supports OS () X 10.9 and newer. Regardless of Xcode version, older OS () X SDK is not needed to build with support for older versions of macOS, but support for older macOS versions has to be explicitly turned on during the build of OpenCPN, wxWidgets and other libraries as described below. There are required development tools that can be installed via Homebrew (https://brew.sh) (or similarly from MacPorts, but it is unsupported and untested). Install Home-brew: $ /usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\" Install cmake and gettext via Homebrew: $ brew install cmake $ brew install gettext Add the gettext tools to your PATH environment variable using: $ echo 'export PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/gettext/bin:$PATH\"'>> ~/.bash_profile Install Tinyxml: $ brew install tinyxml And either restart Terminal.app or reload your environment using ~/.bash_profile If you are building OpenCPN with SVG support (default), Cairo library is needed, install it using: $ brew install cairo Additionally, to support all the features of the wxSVG component, libexif should be installed using: $ brew install libexif If you are building OpenCPN with extended archive support (default, required to download and unpack up to date GSHHG basemaps and pilot charts using the chart downloader plugin), libarchive library is needed, install it using: $ brew install xz libarchive [Read following note - install only if necessary] - To produce binaries fully compatible with older macOS versions on newer macOS, libarchive must instead of from Homebrew, be built as follows: $ export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9 $ wget https://libarchive.org/downloads/libarchive-3.3.3.tar.gz $ tar zxf libarchive-3.3.3.tar.gz $ cd libarchive-3.3.3 $ ./configure --without-lzo2 --without-nettle --without-xml2 --without-openssl --with-expat make $ make install $ cd .. OpenCPN is built upon wxWidgets, a package providing a cross-platform UI SDK. But to get results fully compatible with the official OpenCPN builds, which retain compatibility with macOS Mavericks (10.9) and newer, wxWidgets must be version 3.1.2 built manually as follows: Download wxWidgets-3.1.2.tar.bz2 from: https://www.wxwidgets.org/news/2018/12/wxwidgets-3.1.2-released/ Unzip and move wxWidgets-3.1.2 folder to Desktop Install wxWidgets 3.1.2: $ mkdir build-release && cd build-release $ ../configure --with-cxx=11 --with-macosx-version-min=10.9 --enable-unicode --with-osx-cocoa --enable-aui --disable-debug --with-opengl $ make -j2 $ sudo make install To create .pkg files for plugins, download the “Packages” tool from s.sudre.free.fr Install Packages.dmg by double-clicking the file and following the instructions - no need to open Packages.app as the installer configures the necessary command line tools for Packages. Check Configuration for problems or errors: $ brew doctor If everything is installed OK, you should get the message \"Your system is ready to brew\" Officially OpenCPN is built from the command line, but it’s also possible to use Apple’s Xcode IDE for development. Regardless of which method we choose, the first steps are the same: Get the OpenCPN source: $ git clone https://github.com/OpenCPN/OpenCPN.git Create the build directory, where our local builds will take place, so that we don’t work directly in the source tree: $ mkdir OpenCPN/build && cd OpenCPN/build Build Method 1 - From the command line Prepare our build environment: $ export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9 $ cmake .. Build OpenCPN: $ make To build a debug version use: $ export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9 $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .. $ make Build Method 2 - Using Xcode Create the Xcode project: $ export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9 $ cmake -G Xcode .. Open the OpenCPN.xcodeproj file in Xcode, and use the “Build”, “Run”, “Debug”, etc features as normal. To use the “Run” action you need to build the “OpenCPN” target rather than the default “ALL_BUILD” target. Build and install OpenCPN: $ make install WARNING - Do The Following: The default install location is (/usr/local/bin). Everything from /usr/local/bin get’s packaged into your DMG which is not desirable. To avoid this, change the install location with 'cmake' as follows: $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/Users/dsr/tmp .. Some developers have reported that the install step copies a redundant set of the wxWidgets dynamic library into the install directory, causing OpenCPN to fail. This is intended, but gets annoying for local bundles not intended to be distributed. A kludgey fix: $ sudo rm /usr/local/bin/OpenCPN.app/Contents/MacOS/libwx*dylib Build the installable DMG: $ make create-dmg Depending on your local system, during both steps above you may observe insufficient permissions on some files. Either fix the permissions or use sudo to run make install/create-dmg To install the application, double-click on the DMG in Finder and drag OpenCPN.app to the Applications directory.

It reliably got them to wherever they were headed; from Newfoundland to the Bahamas. The public wasn’t even aware of it at the time. Dave began sharing the program with other cruisers here and there, which planted the idea to put it out publicly for anyone to download as open source.

The maintainers supports plugin developers in all stages from creating the pot-file to adding the translated po-files to the project The OpenCPN plugins shares the i18n infrastructure with the main opencpn program. In particular, plugins are subprojects in the main opencpn project at Crowdin. The workflow is based on the gettext tools and the Crowdin translation web service. In the end this converts all strings like _(some string) to translated content in runtime, content which is taken from machine-dependent, binary mo-files. The workflow: The source files' translatable strings are marked using the `_()`macro. Using the xgettext tool, the translatable strings are extracted to a pot file. The pot file is sent to the i18n maintainers who submits it to the crowdin web translation service. Here, each plugin is a sub-project under the opencpn project. Translators translates the pot file to all sorts of languages using the Crowdin web service, as exemplified here. A note in the i18n thread from translator when she is completed is appreciated. The maintainers downloads the translated po files to and makes a PR against the plugin The plugin developer merges the PR which updates the po translations. During the build process, each po-file is compiled to a mo-file. These are the files used in runtime to provide translations. \"Items\" and \"Texts\" rule 1 Item in the language file 1 = Display text. Of course, this requires you to put more items in this file, but this is the only way for each translator to take account of the peculiarities of its language. Currently, all the other plugins and the heart of OpenCPN follow this rule and we can always translate very correctly. Translation priority between core and plugin I have a question about translation priority between core and plugins, …​.How can this be dealt with? It depends. Many plugins loads translations from both core and and the plugin. This is the scenario when no specific steps are taken to avoid it. In this case, if both the plugin and main OpenCPN translates the same item, the main program wins and the plugin translation is unused. The upside is that the plugin can re-use common translations from the main program. To avoid translation conflicts, plugin developers must ensure that the items they use are different from those of the core. It is not necessary that the difference is big, one different character is enough. Plugins can be configured to just use translations from the plugin, avoiding the overlap with the main program. See the plugin templates page.","title":"Internationalization (i18n)","component":"ocpn-dev-manual","version":"0.1","name":"dm-i18n","url":"/ocpn-dev-manual/0.1/dm-i18n.html","titles":[{"text":"Summary","hash":"i18n-overview","id":1},{"text":"The i18n maintainers","hash":"_the_i18n_maintainers","id":2},{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":3},{"text":"Notes","hash":"_notes","id":4}]},"14":{"id":14,"text":"The term Legacy Plugins refers to plugins installed without involving the Plugin Manager or any other part of the OpenCPN core.

You are most welcome! There are many ways to participate, most of which not requiring programming skills. This manual is about contributing to the code. OpenCPN is an open-source project. The core parts uses a GPL version 2 or later license (GPLv2+), but there are a lot of other licenses in dependencies used. Contributions to the project must be licensed under an open-source license, normally GPLv2+. The starting point for developer activities is in many cases the OpenCPN forum at FlySpray. Here, end-user reports problems and sometimes also submits enhancement requests (RFEs). For the core OpenCPN project development work is done on the OpenCPN Github site. Github issues are filed for more specific problems or RFEs. Pull requests (PR) is the way used to include patches and new functionality into the program. The core developers sometimes hangs around in the OpenCPN Zulip instance. Zulip is an open-source groupware resembling of Slack. The instance is available at https://opencpn.zulipchat.com is at the time of writing open to all Github users. Dave (@bdbcat) is the lead developer and makes decisions on if/when/how to merge a PR. Also Pavel (@nohal) and Alec Leamas (@leamas) has commit rights in the project. There are no formal roles besides these. To contact the project as a developer, filing issues and/or making comments on existing ones is the easiest way to join the community. The community also has a vast number of Plugins on Github.

[Hakan] offers his help to relieve the pressure on Pavel and Dave. So he’ll of course do what he can whenever possible and needed. What a plugin developer has to do is give us a message whenever the code is ready enough to update Crowdin, that’s the main issue. If potfiles.in and the xxx_pi.pot is also updated in source it’s very fine. But the message to any or all of is the main task. Then we will try to watch Crowdin for updated translations but a forum note from translators is of course also appreciated. 1. Plugin developer determines when to advise Hakan, Pavel & Dave when there are going to be no more new strings so that a *.POT file can be developed. 2. Hakan, Pavel or Dave develop the [plugin].pot file and post it to Crowdin announcing a deadline by which language updates must be ready. 3. Hakan, Pavel or Dave make a Pull Request to the plugin developer with the completed language *.PO files. 4. Plugin developer merges the Pull Request and then the languages become available when the plugin in is built the next time. https://crowdin.com/project/opencpn Translators are needed. Please register and login, to help us translate. [We need a description of how this is done in Crowdin in this section.] 1. Once you have logged into the Crowdin OpenCPN Project, you can select a language. 2. You will be presented with an outline of OpenCPN and each of the plugins that are available. 3. These sections show the % Completed. Clicking on a section, will allow you to add translations word by word or phrase by phrase. 4. When the translations have been completed for OpenCPN or one of the plugins, the developers then move the completed files into the \"build\" process to embed the translations into OpenCPN or the Plugins. This is not an instantaneous thing and requires communication and coordination with the translators. So translators should leave messages in the forum when they are done. We suggest using the Internationalization thread for leaving messages of this nature. as described by Gerhard. The first job is to make or update the POTFILES.IN which is simply a list of all source file names that have language strings. This file lives in the PO directory. There appears to be no real difference between Windows and other operating systems for making po/mo files. You need the \"gettext\" command, make a search for gettext for Windows in Google. Also you need to know how the Terminal works, especially the path handling. The Compiling thread has instructions for installing gettext. Then first make an ASCII file called POTFILES.in when not available already, which holds all source file names of your plugin line by line, but only those files which may contain language strings. These language strings are preceded with _(\" , that is underscore, bracket open and quotation mark. e.g.: _(\"This is a text for translations.\") In the Terminal you use the gettext command like this: gettext –from-code=iso-8859-1 –force-po –package-name=xyz_pi –package-version=1.0 –output=xyz_pi.pot –keyword=_ –width=80 –files-from=POTFILES.in So the parameters for gettext are –from-code= the kind of code –force-po to force a po file –package-name= the name of the plugin –package-version= the version of the plugin –output= the name of the resulting pot file –keyword=_ as explained above –with=80 the length –files-from= POTFILES.in the list of files to be processed If you think there are strings missing in the resulting pot file go to the plugin source files and look there for these strings. Perhaps they are preceded with _T(\" or wxT(\" and not with _(\" If you have already an old po file you can merge it with your new pot file using the msgmerge command which is part of the gettext bundle. Use msgmerge –help in the Terminal window to see how it works. Otherwise simply make a copy of your new pot file with the extension po to receive an empty po file for the translation work with Poedit. as described by Hakan 1. Update the \"potfiles.in\". See Gerhard’s description above. 2. Then produce a fresh \" weather_routing_pi.pot \" file. 3. With a new updated pot-file Hakan can update Crowdin in a minute, so that translators can complete the work. So unless no one can update potfiles.in and produce a fresh \" weather_routing_pi.pot \" file In VS2013 use \"Build only\" of the POT file project, but first be sure that potfiles.in is updated. Hakan needs the fresh pot file to update Crowd Source. 1. Open Visual Studio 2013 2. Open weather_routing_pi.sln located in the build directory of weather_routing_pi local git directory. 3. Find in Solution Explorer \"weather_routing-pot-update\" and expand it there should be cmake rules, etc. 4. Right click on \"weather_routing-pot-update\" and select the third down \"Project only\", then select \"Build Only \"weather_routing-pot-update\". 5. Output window shows Build: 1 Succeeded 0 Failed (Did the same with \"weather_routing-po-update\" which builds only the po files.) You may Upload the [Plugin_pi].pot file to Hakan via the forum as attachment or via email.* weather_routing_pi.pot (take off the pdf) So I just uploaded the file to the forum thread here as an example and very soon afterwards Hakan reported that the files on Crowd Source were updated and ready for the Translators.

When OpenCPN starts it will look for files named styleXXX.xml (where the XXX means that any text is allowed here) in the uidata subdirectory of the installation, and also in the user settings directory (** ~/.opencpn *under Linux). Each style.xml file defines one or several styles. The overall structure of the file should look like this: All bitmaps that the style needs are defined in a PNG file, which is named in the * ** tag. The various tags refer to bitmap locations in this file. Locations are in X/Y coordinates with the upper left corner as (0,0) and with positive Y downwards. This file should be a 24 bit PNG. Transparency is fully supported, you can use semitransparent icons and backgrounds to combine various effects. The tag contains overall parameters for the and versions of the toolbar. This makes it possible to have non-square buttons and still have the toolbar nicely rendered in both orientations. The separation distance is the separation in pixels between two toolbar buttons. When using non-square buttons the tool icon might have different positions on the background for horizontal and vertical. In this case, position the icons correctly for the horizontal case, and then specify the offset for the vertical case using the tag where X/Y are in pixels and are allowed to be negative. The margins are the margins around the outside, measured in pixels. The margin can also be made transparent. With a transparent toolbar the window edge snap will have a space between the window edge and the buttons. and should provide two different backgrounds, one for the non-toggled and one for the toggled (or pressed) state of the button. The toggled background is allowed to be larger (but not smaller) than the no-toggled. If you use this feature, make sure to specify enough spacing and margins to render the larger background properly. The tag specifies a default size for tools, but this can be overridden for an individual tool in its own tag. The toolbar can be further styled with nice looking start and end images using the tags.

This file will have a META-URL redirect to your new private branch. Example follows: In this case the path & file is [GitUser]/plugins/Alpha/metadata/meta-url-alpha-seandepagnier-rgleason.xml The text in the xml file is: Sean Depagnier Alpha Plugins meta-url 1.0 meta-url to Sean's Alpha Plugins by rgleason https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgleason/plugins/rg-alpha/ocpn-plugins.xml Check the new file for format, accuracy and complete tags. Next run the python tool to build a new ocpn-plugins.xml by executing at the command prompt from the /plugins/ directory ''python tools/ocpn-metadata generate –force –userdir metadata –destfile ocpn-plugins.xml '' See the README. This command collects all the files into one file. You will need to have python configured on your computer.

BETA - Testing Retainage - Limit by days 0 disabled, Limit by count 223 packages, Limit by Size 0 disabled. (See general comments above.) PROD - Releases, Retainage - Limit by days 0 disabled, Limit by count 223 packages, Limit by Size 0 disabled. (See general comments above.) Generally, plugins that are deployed to the Plugin Manager should be located in this repository. The retainage for this repository should retain at least the 4 last releases. Currently each plugin has between 12-15 environments, each environment deploys a tarball and metadata file and may deploy one additional file (for deb linux, exe windows or pkg macos file). 15 environments x 3 files x 4 releases = 180 packages. Test the Plugin again using your OS, it is your responsibility to make sure your plugin works properly and is \"clean\" code. - Change version in CMakeList.txt then push your tag in the same step as the commit. If you are working on the master branch the workflow should be something like this: $ git commit -am \"my last changes\") $ git tag v[new version number] $ git push OR $ git push origin refs/tags/tag_a Not preferred: $ git push --tags origin master:master v1.9.5.10 The last step pushes the tag and the branch in one step, thus avoiding the problem of deployment being split between \"prod\" and \"beta\". It’s also much simpler. (All tags from your local clone are pushed to origin. If this is a problem they can also be removed.) - Deploy the release your \"Prod\" Cloudsmith repository. Check the binary and catalog files deployed to your \"Prod\" Cloudsmith repository. Copy your catalogs metadata (xml) and main icon to your local opencpn/plugins/metadata repository Generate a local ocpn-plugins.xml so that the uploaded tarballs can be tested and then push it up to your forked repository. See README and read suggested steps below. (See process below) Push your new ocpn-pugins.xml catalog to your remote repository From inside OpenCPN use PI Installer to load your new ocpn-plugins.xml, then select your new plugin to load it. Confirm the plugin loads and works properly. Make a Pull Request of the new [plugin]catalog.xml files (typically 4 xml files) and an Icon file to https://github.com/OpenCPN/plugins from your forked opencpn-plugins directory. If your release is acceptable it will then be published in the next update of the opencpn-plugin.XML and become available to the users. Note: You can now create a meta-url in the Alpha branch (Catalog) which points to your own opencpn/plugins branch where you can make an ocpn_plugins.xml with all your current alpha metadata, which will appear for installation by alpha and beta testers when the Alpha catalog is picked and updated. This is very handy because it does not involve any PR and Merge by Dave. To revert to a previous version, make a PR to OpenCPN/plugins of the version you wish to revert to. Email the lead developer. (Draft) How does the Plugin Developer test deployment and installation of their plugin … and the generated ocpn-plugins.xml? There are three alternatives: Combine the metadata by hand in an xml file with the name ocpn-plugins.xml and then point PI Installer at that file, however there is no reason at all to do it by hand. Load an OpenCPN version built with the PI Installer and select the appropriate XML url. The ocpn-metadata tool automates the use of a new XML file with correct urls. Such xml files are produced by the CI builds. A PI Dev can git clone OpenCPN/plugins, copy your cloudsmith repository’s modified XML files into the metadata/dir and run ocpn-metadata which then creates a new ocpn-plugins.xml. This is easier to automate and less error-prone. You will need to have Python > v3.4 More Detail Fork the opencpn-plugins https://github.com/OpenCPN/plugins to your github repository. Use the master branch and copy/add the recently created xml and icons from cloudsmith. Run the batch file or python file to make a local opencpn-plugins.xml (or do it by hand). Test installation of the new plugin from the PI Installer using the subject Opencpn OS. Point the PI Installer (Under Options>Plugins> Click on the red \"+\") and point the xml file to the appropriate url. Plugin Installer activated at the \"+\" PI Installer menu to Load a URL directly Select your plugin for installation. Confirm it installs and works properly. Then, if ok, Deploy the Release to your \"stable\" Cloudsmith repository with a new version number with a Push Tag Then, Make a PR to https://github.com/OpenCPN/plugins from your fork. with your new xml metadata files, and icon so the plugin is included.","title":"PI Manager Dev Procedure","component":"ocpn-dev-manual","version":"0.1","name":"pi_installer_dev_procedure","url":"/ocpn-dev-manual/0.1/pi_installer_dev_procedure.html","titles":[{"text":"Build and Deploy","hash":"_build_and_deploy","id":1},{"text":"Deploy to \"Beta\" Repository","hash":"_deploy_to_beta_repository","id":2},{"text":"\"Beta\" Test","hash":"_beta_test","id":3},{"text":"Deploy to \"Prod\" Repository","hash":"_deploy_to_prod_repository","id":4},{"text":"PLACEHOLDER NOTE","hash":"_placeholder_note","id":5},{"text":"Reversion","hash":"_reversion","id":6},{"text":"PI Installer and Deployment","hash":"_pi_installer_and_deployment","id":7}]},"26":{"id":26,"text":"When OpenCPN tries to load a plugin it must match strict criterias to be loaded.

However, in some cases like when cross-compiling this is not possible and the value must be given to cmake’s OCPN_TARGET_TUPLE option.

For test purposes, the built-in values can be modified so that OpenCPN actually loads a plugin which is not compatible according to these rules. This is done by modifying the target and version values OpenCPN compares with the plugin. This can be done in three ways: env variable OPENCPN_COMPAT_TARGET should be target:version, for example ubuntu-x86_64:20.04 which should make OpenCPN attempt to load plugins compiled for ubuntu version 20.04. The configuration variables CompatOS and CompatOsVersion in the [Settings] section works likewise if modified manually before starting (CompatOS is the same as target) The catalog Settings GUI has a dropdown for selecting the compatibility target.

The recommended way to create a new plugin is to use an existing plugin as starting point and modify it in steps rather than to start from scratch. The plugin API describes how a plugin interacts with the OpenCPN core. It is described in the API Page. OpenCPN is a cross-platform project, and basically every plugin is compiled for different platforms. The core OpenCPN evaluates a plugin’s ABI compatibility in a rather strict way as described in the ABI compatibility page. There is also some notes on the ABI in the API Page. Plugins should take special steps if depending on libraries besides those used by the core OpenCPN. More info on this in Dependencies Since 5.4.0 the plugin installer is the main deployment method. An overview can be found here. The reference documentation is in the Plugin Installer Site. Plugins deployed this way are available for user to install in the OpenCPN GUI. In this scheme, plugins are distributed as archives basically containing a metadata description, a dynamic library, data files and translations. The installer defines the layout of the archive and how these files are installed on the client’s computer. The exact paths involved are described in the Tarball layout page. Note that all areas described here are owned by the installer and must not be modified by the plugin. This includes data files and directories created by the installer. Plugins which need to save configuration and other data uses the configuration directory which is described in the Terminology page. Historically, plugins have been distributed as operating system packages. From version 5.6.0 this is not longer supported, only the built-in plugin installer [above] is used. For a plugin to be available for end users, it must be included in the catalog. The catalog as well as tooling and processes to maintain it is governed by the catalog project at github. The PI deployment scheme utilizes a number of services to build and distribute plugins. There are two sets of templates available: The testplugin templates The shipdriver templates The deployment for basically all existing plugins is using one of these two sets of templates.

The UI in the program, a list of plugins, is based on the catalog. Librarian The librarian, really Dave, manages the catalog which is continously updated. The flow from developer to user of a plugin: Developer updates the plugin code, commits and pushes to Github. The commit on Github activates the CI builders, like CircleCI (there is typically more of them), which starts building the plugin for various platforms. Each CI build results in a tarball and a metadata file for a specific platform. The tarball is uploaded to Cloudsmith, a binary repository from which users can download it. The metadata is sent to the librarian who reviews it. If accepted, the librarian merges the metadata into the catalog. User updates the catalog regularly, downloading the last version of the catalog to the computer. When there is a need, user locates a plugin to download in the catalog. Catalog metadata provides the url which is used to download and install the plugin. A lot of services are mentioned in this text.

This is the only option in the flatpak case. OTOH, the flatpak runtime is quite large and contains a lot of common libraries. Link statically. Preliminary findings are that this works on MacOS but not in Debian; Debian static libs seems to be compiled without -fPIC which means the they cannot be linked into a shared library. YMMV. Bundle the dynamic library. By default. linux has an RPATH which points to both the plugin directory and it’s parent. This means that a library .so file bundled in any of these locations will be used by the plugin. The photolayer_pi plugin contains examples on all these strategies. The proj and libgeotiff libs are rebuilt from sources. The libtiff library is bundled on Debian and linked statically on MacOS. The \"rebuild from source\" is done in libs/geotiff and the flatpak yaml manifest.

There are two examples on the this process [oesenc_pi](https://github.com/bdbcat/oesenc_pi/). This is as complicated as it gets with binary helpers, extra libs and data. [ShipDriver_pi](https://github.com/Rasbats/shipdriver_pi) is simpler example, but still complex enough to cover most plugin cases. The repo contains a branch called patches which a clean , rewritten history how the adaptation is done. The item to test is a tarball. The easiest way to test it is to use the new \"Import plugin\" function which allows using a plugin directly without downloading it from an url. More complete testing requires the plugin to be available in a catalog. See the plugins project at https://github.com/opencpn/plugins The preferred style for cmake files is the modern one with lower_case commands, two spaces indentation and plain endif (), something like if (MSVC) set(_msvc_flag \"some value\") endif () This is supported by the cmake-format utility, https://github.com/cheshirekow/cmake_format. A .cmake-format options file to use is part of the [ShipDriver_pi](https://github.com/Rasbats/shipdriver_pi) plugin. cmake-format has also been used with the same settings in the main opencpn project where it has been used to format several thousand of lines with good results.","title":"Adapt Plugin","component":"ocpn-dev-manual","version":"0.1","name":"pm-tp-adapt-plugin","url":"/ocpn-dev-manual/0.1/pm-tp-adapt-plugin.html","titles":[{"text":"Add necessary plugin path changes for 1.16","hash":"_add_necessary_plugin_path_changes_for_1_16","id":1},{"text":"Add Icon SVG Changes","hash":"_add_icon_svg_changes","id":2},{"text":"Adapting plugins to the installer","hash":"_adapting_plugins_to_the_installer","id":3},{"text":"Testing a new or modified plugin","hash":"_testing_a_new_or_modified_plugin","id":4},{"text":"Source code formatting","hash":"_source_code_formatting","id":5}]},"38":{"id":38,"text":"Plugin: Testplugin_pi Github: https://github.com/jongough/testplugin_pi Author: Jon Gough CI-CMake Template v1.0.160 Fully functional plugin Uses OCPN interfaces and demonstrates how to use the ocpn_draw_pi API, JSON & Binary versions.

FIXME Your plugin will need to be augmented with new CMake and script files. There are two versions you can select from Frontend1 and Frontend2. The main Frontend1 example is in github.com\\bdbcat\\oesenc_pi and a more annotated version is in rgleason/squiddio_pi branch frontend1 The main Frontend2 example is in github.com/jongough/testplugin_pi and more annotated ashttps://github.com/rgleason/squiddio_pi/tree/frontend2[github.com/rgleason/squiddio_pi Branch frontend2] The simplest way is to copy the new files in ci & cmake to your system and make the requisite changes to the CMakeLists.txt, of which there shouldn’t be too many as it is really the individual plugins file, i.e. has all the customization in. All changes for customisation should be constrained to the CMakeLists.txt file, because all the other files are parameter driven and so 'should' be the same between plugins. So all the files in the: 'cmake' directory, including the in-files directory, are the same for every plugin, there should be no customisation to these files. There are 'extra' cmake files which a plugin may use, i.e. FindPortaudio.cmake for the weather_routing_pi, but these are supplied by the plugin and are referenced vis CMakeLists.txt in the plugin customisation section. 'ci' directory should not require hand customisation as again all the files are parameter (global variable) driven '.circleci' directory should not require hand customisation as again all the files are parameter (global variable) driven 'debian' directory should not require hand customisation 'mingw' directory should not require hand customisation Updates of plugins require copying the above directories in place and then carefully updating the CMakeLists.txt file by referencing the testplugin_pi version to change it to the new format and include all the 'standard' parts that are needed. It should be quite easy to get it working, while testing on the web takes longer as jobs need to finish, to determine what needs fixing. So if you look through the first section of the CMakeLists.txt you will see where you set the cloudsmith user and repository name as well as the 'special' stuff for the xml file. The next section down you may need to change a few default settings, i.e. 'USE_GL', or some special version of c++ that is needed. In the current file the following section (line 194 onwards) is where you define all the files to be used. You will need to keep 'SRCS' as the source list, but the rest of it is up to you. You will also need the last section which does the rest of the build and package process. I would not try to 'combine' this process with any other in the same 'stream' or you are likely to have problems. When I make changes just copy the new files in place and, if needed, make the co-requisite changes to CMakeLists.txt . The idea of this process is that it is a 'black box' to most and it should 'just work'. You will notice that I have changed the names of the repositories to '…-prod', '…-beta' and '…-alpha', it just seemed to match what was going into them. The destination repository is controlled by what you are doing, i.e. - Any non-master branch network build -> alpha repository Master build without tag and non-master branch build with tag -> beta repository Master build with tag -> prod repository All 'installation' files, 'deb', 'dmg', 'exe', etc will also go into the same repository, but they will have the current naming strategy, i.e. will start with 'opencpn-plugin-' the the rest of the descriptive name.

This documentation is a WIP. Current parts: PI Manager Dev Setup Testplugin and Frontend2 FIXME: This is moved from languages: it’s specific for the testplugin setup, but certainly don’t belong here. wxWidgets provide a macro to help with the translation of strings into the local language. This is done using the macro, normally seen as _(\"string\") in the code. At compile time this is translated to wxTranslation(\"string\") which at runtime will return the string \"string\" translated into the local language. The translation is done by matching the string \"string\" in the language catalog set (all the catalogs that have been loaded for OCPN). The first match that is found is returned. It is possible for each plugin to use the same words for different meanings, eg. \"Port\" can mean \"Communications Port\", \"Harbor\", \"Port of Entry\", \"Port Side\", \"Porthole\", etc. Unfortunately as the first instance of the word is returned the translation may not be appropriate. The upside of this is if you use strings that have not been translated in your catalog, then it may have been in another and this translation will be returned. The downside is that you cannot specify, using wxWidgets macro, which catalog to use. The wxTranslation method comes in two flavors wxTranslation(\"string\") wxTranslation(\"string\", \"catalog\") You could use this in your code, but it would be long winded. It is possible to redefine the macro such that it will use the second form if \"catalog\" is specified. The following shows how this can be done to allow the code to maintain the look of all the other code in OCPN and the PlugIns. If you use Pavel’s/Sean’s PlugIn cmake file set you will have a file called PluginConfigure.cmake in the \"cmake\" directory of your project. This file needs a new line adding: configure_file(cmake/wxWTranslateCatalog.h.in ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include/wxWTranslateCatalog.h) This line is added after the line: configure_file(cmake/version.h.in ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include/version.h) The name of the input template file and the output header file can be changed. The name was picked to signify \"wxWidgets Translate with Catalog\".

It should be placed after the wxWidgets includes to ensure that it can redefine the macro. The \"version.h.in\" used by this cmake process also needs to be updated with two new lines: #define PLUGIN_NAME ${PROJECT_NAME} #define PLUGIN_CATALOG_NAME wxS(\"opencpn-${PROJECT_NAME}\") The whole \"version.h.in\" file should look like: #define PLUGIN_NAME ${PROJECT_NAME} #define PLUGIN_CATALOG_NAME wxS(\"opencpn-${PROJECT_NAME}\") #define PLUGIN_VERSION_MAJOR ${VERSION_MAJOR} #define PLUGIN_VERSION_MINOR ${VERSION_MINOR} #define PLUGIN_VERSION_PATCH ${VERSION_PATCH} #define PLUGIN_VERSION_DATE \"{VERSION_DATE}\" To implement this the code you use to set the locale catalog needs to change from: AddLocaleCatalog( opencpn-your_plugin-name_pi ); to: AddLocaleCatalog( PLUGIN_CATALOG_NAME ); The \"PLUGIN_CATALOG_NAME\" is translated at compile time to the correct name for your plugin. This ensures that you are using the same catalog as that added to OpenCPN. This is really a failsafe. This is quite simple. Once you have created the wxWTranslateCatalog.h file you can include it in all generated header files by a single change to the project file. Open wxFormBuilder with the project file you want to change, then go to Properties/C++ Properties/class_decoration/header and enter wxWTranslateCatalog.h in that field. This will append this header file after all the wxWidgets headers and allow it to redefine the \"_()\" macro to use the project local catalog. Now there is no need to change the generated file to make it work. Proposed by NAV. More important is probably the simple procedure I used to make it (ready in a few minutes): 1. Go to GITHUB; 2. Find the correct repository (master branch); 3. Open po-file of the language you’re interested in; 4. Click on \"Raw\"; 5. Copy all; 6. Paste to two different sheets (e.g. 1 and 2) of Excel; 7. Delete all empty rows on sheet 1 (use Excel Add On to do this with a few mouse clicks); 8. Filter on \"msgid\" in sheet 1; 9. Delete all hidden rows on sheet 1 (use Excel Add On to do this with a few mouse clicks); 10. Delete all empty rows on sheet 2; 11. Filter on \"msgstr\" in sheet 2; 12. Delete all hidden rows on sheet 2; 13. Copy all msgstr rows from sheet 2 to next empty column in sheet 1; 14. Check results. 15. Add plugin name in separate column for all copied rows; 16. Add sequential number in separate column to be able to re-sort. The Excel Add On I use adds additional functionality, of which I only used two for this procedure.

You will need to get at least 1.9.048 of the WatchDog plugin to see examples of its use. The ODAPI.h file contains typedef statements that make it easier to use the API. All the API’s are defined here so you use the typedef to define a variable to hold the address of the correct API and then use this to execute the API. The original ODAPI only had four functions which were read only: OD_FindPathByGUID - Find a path of any type by its GUID OD_FindPointInAnyBoundary - Find if a Lat/Lon is inside any boundary OD_FindClosestBoundaryLineCrossing - Find if a line crosses a boundary line and will return the closest line crossing OD_FindFirstBoundaryLineCrossing - Find if a line crosses a boundary and return as soon as a crossing is detected These were initially used by the WatchDog and WeatherRouting plugins. With OD 1.5 (beta) and OD 1.6 there are new API’s available to allow creation of objects. These are: OD_CreateBoundary - Create a Boundary OD_CreateBoundaryPoint - Create an isolated Boundary Point OD_CreateTextPoint - Create a Text Point OD_DeleteTextPoint - Delete a Text Point OD_AddPointIcon - Add an OD Point icon that can be used OD_DeletePointIcon - Delete a previously added OD Point icon This now allows use of some of the OD drawing tools by other plugins. An updated version of Squiddio_pi is available, also beta, which can use either OCPN Waypoints or OD Text Points for the display of information. The change has been made to the method of displaying the information but not to the functionality of Squiddio. To help with understanding of how to use the new API’s and for testing purposes a new plugin has been created, testplugin_pi (https://github.com/jongough/testplugin_pi). This plugin can use either the ODAPI binary interface or JSON text form to drive OD. The names of the API’s should be self explanatory as to what they do and reference to the testplugin should help with understanding. https://github.com/seandepagnier/weather_routing_pi/issues/191#issuecomment-385209963 There are two methods of interacting with OD programatically, OCPN messaging using JSON messages and the ODAPI. Basically the OCPN messaging is synchronous and broadcast, so every plugin gets the message being sent and the originator is blocked until the message process completes. Also, the message is in JSON format which requires decoding, so every plugin that is registered for messaging has to decode the message to see if it is interested in it. The ODAPI uses the messaging process to give out the real address of the API, but once this is done it is possible to call the available OD functions directly with a C structure. So the OCPN JSON message is useful for letting multiple plugins know what is going on and for low message rate processes. For targeted, high rate, message/communitaions it is not really usable in its current format (Dave said he was going to look into it for OCPN V5). For Watchdog and Weather Routing the message rate can be high and it is only for OD, no one else should be interested in the messages, so the ODAPI was created to avoid the JSON overhead and to allow plugins to communicate directly with OD (in fact execute OD code as it was part of their plugin). Basically the ODAPI is defined in ODAPI.h which should be used by any plugin wishing to use the binary interaction method, there is also the ODJSONSchemas.h file which defines the JSON version of the API in a schema format. There is as yet no globally usable parser for this version of the schema (still waiting for another open source development to catch up with the JSON standards).","title":"Ocpn_Draw ODAPI","component":"ocpn-dev-manual","version":"0.1","name":"pm-tp-ocpn_draw_odapi","url":"/ocpn-dev-manual/0.1/pm-tp-ocpn_draw_odapi.html","titles":[{"text":"Updated ODAPI for faster access OCPN_Draw capabilities","hash":"_updated_odapi_for_faster_access_ocpn_draw_capabilities","id":1},{"text":"Additional Notes about ODAPI","hash":"_additional_notes_about_odapi","id":2},{"text":"Additionally Jon Gough writes:","hash":"_additionally_jon_gough_writes","id":3},{"text":"Jon advises","hash":"_jon_advises","id":4}]},"43":{"id":43,"text":"ODAPI is not part of the official API/ABI which is between all plugins and OpenCPN core.

The Pi is power hungry and especially for multi-core compilations and later on moving and zooming maps, you’ll need full power. A 1.5 Amps mobile phone charger won’t do it, most of the 2 Amps neither, especially in combination with ultra thin wired USB signal cables! The Pi seems to create enormous current bursts, rather than a continuous current flow. My Amp meter shows an average flow of only 0.5A, but I know that the spikes will go up to 2-3 Amps! Zooming, panning and heavy display activities cause these bursts, hence if your Pi crashes during such actions, it’s most likely due to insufficient power or too thin cables. A quality Class 10 SD-Card. Most of instabilities or latencies come from lousy SD-Cards or insufficient power supplies Good Storage. You might wonder, where to put your chart files. Either, buy a bigger SD card (32 Gb),or leave the SD card for Jessie and the app and add a decent USB Memory stick. The Pi mounts memory sticks automatically under /media/… The Pi is picky concerning mem sticks! $sudo apt-get update $sudo apt-get dist-upgrade Use RASPI-CONFIG to enable OpenGL. Since the driver is still Beta, you can’t do this from the GUI Desktop. $ sudo raspi-config ⇒ Advanced Options, “GL Driver”, enable Add the following lines to /boot/config.txt $sudo vi /boot/config.txt framebuffer_depth=32 framebuffer_ignore_alpha=1 Simply follow the Linux build instructions for Ubuntu/Debian Be aware that you also have to make provisions for the HW you want to connect to the Pi, to give you GPS, AIS etc. and where and how you want to connect these to the various interfaces and protocols: In most cases you want gpsd gpsd-clients There is an awful lot of things to consider when adding HW to the Pi, which has nothing to do with compiling OpenCPN for Pis. OpenCPN is just using’em. If that scares you away, consider to use OpenPlotter, which is a pretty nice fully integrated HW & SW solution for amazingly affordable HW prices. May be bitTorrent wasn’t the luckiest choice as distribution channel, but for those who are scared for security, you could buy their prepopulated SD Card for small money. The same applies for the question, how you want later to access the Pi and OpenCPN, underway and away from your home router/LAN. Considering to use the Pi as WiFi access point… Once configured as AP, you can’t use it for accessing public WiFi nets in harbors! When away from your internet@home your Pi won’t have any possibility to fetch the current time, hence after power on, your date/time setting will be ways off! You’ll need to read the date/time from an NMEA GPS message and stitch it into the Pi’s clock. Afterwards, you’ll need the NTP service from e.g. gpsd to keep it accurate. The NTP won’t do the trick alone, because it will not touch your date/time setting, if they are off for more than 1000 secs. Last not least: If the a.m. process does not produce any obvious errors or aborts and you end up with an executable, things should be pretty much OK. Subsequent instabilities are most likely not caused from your compilation or SW bugs all over the place. On a more or less clean installation on an unspoilt RPI, everything should work fine. If not, consider HW issues (as described above). I’m running the Pi headless; that’s because I probably have no issues w/ performance limitation from v-sync on TV screens. 60 fps looks very much NTSC to me! Be sure that you are on a newer Jessie kernel, at least the Dec. 2016 version. I am not so sure about having to switch ON OpenGL in the OpenCPN config menu… I observed some instability on high detailed & quilted charts, when zooming. I switched OFF OpenGL in OpenCPN, but left it ON in the Pi. The amazing result was, that the zoom and pan display speed was equally fast as before, but the instability was gone. The thing runs now since several days beton stable and I can do whatever I want w/out being able to crash it ! This is due to a bug in OpenCPN. Please refer to: https://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134/opencpn-on-raspberry-pi2-140940-18.html#post2322329 Why am I so picky about power bursts? Because in a normal computer, big capacitors are added and power supplies are fast regulators to deal with big power bursts. Mind you, the Intel 4 Core CPUs are rated up to 130W at 1,1V, means 120Amps or so, while in idle mode, actual power consumption is 30W or less. Hence the power consumption jumps between 30 and 130 Watts in milliseconds, as CPU power/load is required. We should understand, that despite the small size of the Pi, the Quad-Core CPU in there is a high performance beast of burden!! Due to the size of the Pi, they had no chances putting big capacitors onto the board, and they unloaded the burst problem to an external power supply, which is then by many users replaced by a simple Mobile wall plug, underestimating the untold power requirements of the Pi. One more word concerning Power. I have seen specs for the Pi, saying it should be supplied w/ 5.1V ! That’s essential, because the Pi has at the entry a self healing poly-fuse and a diode to protect it against power connections in the wrong sense (+/-). The price to pay for is that the self healing fuse has a significant internal resistance; That means that right at the power entry to the Pi there is a loss of 100-200 mV, variable with the current intake. Just running it at a Mobile charger, which are not so stable and go under heavy load even below 5V, the Pi is starving for Power. For the full story and differences between Pi2/3, please refer to the original page, which shows IMHO a bit an optimistic view. Scroll down to the power section of the table and moreover to the respective power chapter in the text. Notice the 2.5A under RPI3 and be aware that the RPI 3 Documentation still lucks individual updates, because the RPI3 is so much similar to the RPI2, except for power ! https://elinux.org/RPi_Hardware In the new PIXEL Desktop, there should be an indication of low power, …. if the Pi still has got enough to switch it on….

You have been warned! This page describes how to create .deb packages usable on Debian based distros like vanilla Debian, Ubuntu, Raspbian, Mint, etc. Work is done on a Debian or Ubuntu host. Uploading an ubuntu package must be done from an Ubuntu host. Here are five main tasks: Importing new opencpn releases into the packaging branches. Creating a new downstream release. Upload a downstream release to an Ubuntu PPA Local test build of the package from existing release Local test build of the package from master Here, the term \"downstream release\" refers to a release based on the same opencpn release but where the packaging has been modified. There is also some support tasks, see the right panel. Creating releases requires a working gpg secret key including the password is available. Verify using something like gpg --export-secret-keys E2EA41DCE2F8A99AD17A1E463A67D5D966D15C5C. This key must be registered on the PPA about the be used. Create a file ~/.devscripts with contents like: DEBSIGN_KEYID=E2EA41DCE2F8A99AD17A1E463A67D5D966D15C5C DEBEMAIL=\"leamas.alec@gmail.com\" DEBFULLNAME=\"Alec Leamas\" Of course, all values here are personal. DEBSIGN_KEYID is the secret key verified above. This key is only required when uploading source packages to an ubuntu PPA. Install development tools $ sudo apt install devscripts git-buildpackage equivs The Debian tools creates things in the parent directory. To handle this, create new, empty directory and put the OpenCPN tree there. Then, get all necessary three branches: $ mkdir OpenCPN $ cd OpenCPN $ git clone --origin upstream https://github.com/OpenCPN/OpenCPN.git $ cd OpenCPN $ git fetch upstream upstream/latest:upstream/latest $ git fetch upstream pristine-tar:pristine-tar $ git fetch upstream ubuntu/numbat:ubuntu/numbat $ git checkout ubuntu/numbat ubuntu/numbat is the branch to use when building Ubuntu Numbat (24.04) packages. Alternatives includes ubuntu/jammy, ubuntu/focal and debian/master. The latter builds packages for the rolling Sid distribution. To update an existing clone: $ git fetch upstream upstream/latest:upstream/latest $ git fetch upstream pristine-tar:pristine-tar $ git checkout ubuntu/numbat $ git pull upstream ubuntu/numbat debian/changelog is picky about the format. Editing by hand is hard. Instead, use the dch tool. It has a multitude of options.In preparation of importing a new version, first update debian/changelog with a new version, something like dch -v 1:5.9.3-beta3+dfsg dch throws you in an editor loaded with debian/changelog. Complete the entry as you consider best. The standard message for a new version is \"New upstream Release\". Create an archive based on a tag. Using the tag v5.9.3-beta3 as example: $ git archive --prefix opencpn-5.9.3-beta3/ --output ../opencpn.tar.gz v5.9.3-beta3 The --prefix part should be modified to reflect current version, but is not critical. Note the trailing slash! Next step is to convert the tarball to a formal debian source tarball. This is about renaming and stripping files not used in the Debian build. Do: $ git checkout ubuntu/numbat. $ mk-origtargz ../opencpn.tar.gz Where ../opencpn.tar.gz is the file created by git archive above. This creates something like ../opencpn.5.10.920.orig.tar.gz_. The version in the filename is taken from debian/changelog. ubuntu/numbat is just an example, see Make a fresh clone above. Nest step is to import this tarball into upstream/latest. Using the tarball created by git-archive above do: $ gbp import-orig ../opencpn_5.9.3~beta3+dfsg.orig.tar.xz Final step is to push these changes: $ gbp push Assuming the new upstream (opencpn) release is available as of above creating a downstream release goes like: Initiate the environment as described above. Clone and checkout all branches, see above. For each release do: Checkout the actual branch like ubuntu/jammy. Work on ubuntu branches must be done on an ubuntu host Create a provisional version entry in debian/changelog using something like dch -v 1:5.10.2+dfsg-1ubuntu1~bpo20.04+2. Create a orig.tar.xz tarball in .. using gbp export-orig. Merge upstream changes using gbp import-ref -u5.9.3-beta3. The -u argument is the last part of an upstream tag like upstream/5.9.3-beta3. Do possible changes in the new release. Note that only files in the debian/ directory can be modified; changes in other files are handled using patches in debian/patches. See Modifying Sources below Commit all changes. Finalize the changelog entry using dch -r. Commit the change in debian/changelog Push the actual branch, for example git push upstream ubuntu/jammy Initiate the environment as described above. Clone and checkout all branches, or update existing clone. See above. Make sure the repo is synchronized: git clean -fxd; git checkout . Create the upstream source tarball: gbp export-orig Create the source package: debuild --no-lintian -S List all available source packages using ls -lt ../*source.changes. Push the most recent package to a PPA using something like: $ dput ppa:leamas-alec/opencpn \\ ../opencpn_5.9.4~beta4+dfsg-1ubuntu1~bpo24.04+1_source.changes Or, a more generic oneliner pushing the most recent source.changes file: $ dput ppa:leamas-alec/opencpn $(ls -t ../*source.changes | head -1) First step is to setup the environment, see above. However, no gpg key is required. Then, create a fresh clone as described above. Install build dependencies: $ mk-build-deps $ sudo dpkg -i *deb # Expect error messages, ignore them $ sudo apt install -f $ git clean -fxd List available upstream tags using git tag -l | grep upstream/. Normally use the most recent one like: $ git clean -fxd; git checkout . $ gbp buildpackage --git-upstream-tag=upstream/whatever -us -uc This builds testable .deb packages in ... First step is to setup the environment, see above. However, no gpg key is required. Make sure the build dependencies are in place, see above Work is done in a clean clone of the master branch. Make sure the remote \"upstream\" exists and update it: $ git config remote.upstream.url > /dev/null || \\ git remote add upstream https://github.com/OpenCPN/OpenCPN.git $ git remote update upstream Checkout the debian/ directory from the packaging branch. At the time of writing, this is only possible for Bookworm: $ git fetch upstream ci/bookworm-backports:ci/bookworm-backports $ git checkout ci/bookworm-backports debian $ git commit -m \"Add debian/ packaging directory from ci/bookworm-backports\" Create a debian changelog entry. This is an example of building a post 5.10 package for the bookworm release, YMMV: $ version=\"1:5.11.0~$(date \"+%Y%m%d%H%m\").$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)-1\" $ dch --distribution bookworm -v \"$version\" \"Test build from master\" $ git add debian/changelog $ git commit -m \"d/changelog: $version\" Create orig tarball. The name of the orig tarball created by mk-origtargz reflects the changelog version. $ git archive --prefix opencpn-5.11.0/ --output ../opencpn.tar.gz HEAD $ mk-origtargz ../opencpn.tar.gz Extract the orig tarball and work in the sources it provides: $ cd .. $ tar xf opencpn-5.11.0*orig*xz $ cd opencpn-5.11.0* And build package. -j4 builds in four parallel pipes, depending on processor you might want to use another value (I typically use -j12). $ debuild -us -uc -j4 One cannot change the opencpn sources when creating a release. However, it is possible to add or modify a patch in debian/patches. These patches are applied when building the opencpn package. The basic workflow starts in a fresh, clean clone and goes like $ gbp pq import --force # All the patches in debian/patches are applied. # Edit sources as desired and do: $ git commit -am \"Reason for this change\" $ gbp pq export $ git add debian/patches/* $ git commit -m \"d/patches: new patch: patch description\" After gbp pq import actually all sorts of changes can be done. As usual, several small changes can and should be committed one by one rather than as a big patch. It is also possible to edit existing patches using the standard git tools, in particular git rebase -i","title":"Creating a Debian/Ubuntu package","component":"opencpn-dev","version":"","name":"create-deb-package","url":"/opencpn-dev/create-deb-package.html","titles":[{"text":"General","hash":"_general","id":1},{"text":"Setting up the environment","hash":"setup","id":2},{"text":"Make a fresh OpenCPN clone.","hash":"create-clone","id":3},{"text":"Import a new opencpn version into packaging branches.","hash":"import-version","id":4},{"text":"Initiate the changelog with a new version","hash":"_initiate_the_changelog_with_a_new_version","id":5},{"text":"Import a release tag into upstream/latest","hash":"_import_a_release_tag_into_upstreamlatest","id":6},{"text":"Push upstream changes","hash":"_push_upstream_changes","id":7},{"text":"Create a downstream release","hash":"src-release","id":8},{"text":"Publish existing downstream release to PPA","hash":"publish","id":9},{"text":"Local test build from existing upstream tag.","hash":"test-build","id":10},{"text":"Local test build from master","hash":"master-build","id":11},{"text":"Modifying sources in a downstream release.","hash":"edit-src","id":12}]},"52":{"id":52,"text":"OpenCPN is configured using cmake. The build is done out-of-tree according to mkdir build cd build cmake [Options] .. build command The build command part is platform dependent whereas the rest is identical on all platforms. The Options part refers to various CMake parameters. They are too many to be documented, this documentation just mentions a few. The best way to get an overview over the available options is to invoke ccmake which displays a comprehensive list of all options, their current values and a short help string. The goal is that all options should have sane default values, and that a basic build should work without using any of them. Three kind of options are heavily used by OpenCPN: Standard CMake variables, documented in https://cmake.org/documentation/, often but not always with a CMAKE_ prefix. OpenCPN specific variables, often with a OCPN_ prefix. Documented in the code which can be viewed using ccmake or something like cmake -LH | grep -B1 OCPN_. wxWidgets-specific options with a wxWidgets_ prefix, documented in https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindwxWidgets.html The default build type is RelWithDebInfo. A common alternative is Debug. Since 5.0.0 OpenCPN supports the GNU install paths, see https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/module/GNUInstallDirs.html CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX governs the path where files are installed in thei installation package. Default is platform-dependent. It’s not uncommon to change this to some other location. Use CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR to change the base directory for plugins; defaults to library location on most platforms, but is 'lib' on Debian. By default off. If enabled, makes latest git commit part of generated installation files; simplifies when having several test builds. OpenCPN is built for a combination of operating system and hardware. This is crucial to determine if a plugin is compatible with the main OpenCPN program or not. On most targets this is computed automatically. In some situations, notably when cross-compiling, this is not possible and must be set in this option. The syntax is target;version;arch like flatpak;20.08;aarch64 or debian:11:x86_64 OpenCPN bundles some libraries which can be found also as system libraries on for example Linux. This option governs whether the bundled libs should be used (OCPN_USE_BUNDLED_LIBS=ON) or the system ones (OCPN_USE_BUNDLED_LIBS=OFF). It can also be set to a comma-separated list of libraries for which the bundled libs should be used. Only code can tell which libraries, though. The package can be built without bundling any documentation using OCPN_BUNDLE_DOCS=OFF. This has the benefit of a considerably smaller package. Also, unfortunately current documentation is non-free in the open-source sence since the sources are not available for technical reasons. Thus, using OCPN_BUNDLE_DOCS=OFF avoids bundling non-free stuff in generated package The documentation is available as a separate download from https://www.opencpn.org for installations built without the bundled docs. Bundling this data is governed by the OCPN_BUNDLE_TCDATA parameter, a boolean. By bundling it the need to install separate tcdata packages can be avoided. If enabled, the boolean option OCPN_BUNDLE_GSHHS bundles the crude GSHHS data. To use more detailed higher levels the chartdldr plugin is always available for user. On Android the native AndroidSound backend is always used. On Windows, the MswSound backend is the default. OCPN_ENABLE_SYSTEM_CMD_SOUND can be used to use the SystemCmdSound backend, OCPN_ENABLE_PORTAUDIO to enable possible existing portaudio. On Linux, portaudio is used if found, else SystemCmdSound. OCPN_ENABLE_PORTAUDIO can be used to disable portaudio, and OCPN_ENABLE_SYSTEM_CMD_SOUND to disable SystemCmdSound in which case the wxWidgets wxSound backend is used. MacOS works basically as Linux, but portaudio is normally not available On all platforms OCPN_SOUND_CMD can be used to preset the command used in SystemCmdSound. The default is computed by probing the build host for commands like aplay, afplay or omxplayer.","title":"CMake Usage and Options","component":"opencpn-dev","version":"","name":"cmake","url":"/opencpn-dev/cmake.html","titles":[{"text":"General","hash":"_general","id":1},{"text":"Build Type — CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE","hash":"_build_typecmake_build_type","id":2},{"text":"Installation paths","hash":"_installation_paths","id":3},{"text":"Include git data in package name — OCPN_CI_BUILD","hash":"_include_git_data_in_package_nameocpn_ci_build","id":4},{"text":"Explicit target specification — OCPN_TARGET_TUPLE","hash":"_explicit_target_specificationocpn_target_tuple","id":5},{"text":"Use system libraries — OCPN_USE_BUNDLED_LIBS","hash":"_use_system_librariesocpn_use_bundled_libs","id":6},{"text":"Bundled documentation","hash":"_bundled_documentation","id":7},{"text":"Current and Tide Data — TCDATA","hash":"_current_and_tide_datatcdata","id":8},{"text":"Shoreline World Wide Background Chart — GSHHS","hash":"_shoreline_world_wide_background_chartgshhs","id":9},{"text":"Sound","hash":"_sound","id":10}]},"53":{"id":53,"text":"┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ Plugins │ Plugins using decoded and raw data messaging │ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ Plugin message API │ └───────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ │ │ ┌───────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ │ Application │ Application messages (decoded data) │ │ │ ├╶╶╶╶╶╶-╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶┤ │ │ │ Message source priorities │ │ │ │ Protocol handlers │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ nmea0183 nmea2000 signalK ... │ │ │ └───────────────────────────────────────────┘ └─────────┘ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ Transport │ Navigation messages (raw data) │ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ Driver registry │ Drivers ├╶╶╶╶╶╶╶-┬╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶-┬╶╶╶╶╶╶╶┬╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶┬╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶╶┬╶╶╶╶╶╶╶┤ │ 0183 │ Actisense │ Linux │ iKonvert │ SignalK │ │ │ │ NGT-1 │ CAN │ │ +ipv4 │ ... │ │ │ │ │ │ TCP/IP │ │ └────────┴───────────┴───────┴──────────┴─────────┴───────┘ All internal communications described here is based on the observable library which is available in libs/. This library implements a basic observable pattern allowing parties to listen a. k. a. subscribe to incoming messages. All new-style drivers are named like comm-drv-\\*. These handles the low-level communication details. Incoming messages from the outside are made available on the navigation messages bus. Both core parts and plugins listens to this bus, acting on messages when they arrive. These messages are of type`ǸavMsg` defined in comm_navmsg.h. This is a unified, common type for all sorts of messages including NMEA2000, NMEA0183 and SignalK. In the core, comm_decoder acts as a dispatcher which listens to the message bus and invokes various parts when messages arrives. comm_decoder also handles priorities when receiving the same data from multiple sources, selecting the data source to use. For plugins, a simplified API is available, see the Plugins Communications API. When sending messages, upper layers needs to know which driver to use. To that end, drivers registers themselves in the drv_registry which maintains an actual list of available drivers.","title":"Communications Overview","component":"opencpn-dev","version":"","name":"comm-overview","url":"/opencpn-dev/comm-overview.html","titles":[]},"54":{"id":54,"text":"The documentation here covers building OpenCPN from source inside a container.

A code base this large requires some kind of organization. The traditional way to organize GUI applications like OpenCPN is the Model - View - Controller (MVC) pattern. However, for various reasons OpenCPN does not follow this. Instead, a late push has been done to split the code into two pieces named Model and Gui where Model indeed corresponds to the MVC \"Model\" while Gui corresponds to the MVC \"View\" and \"Controller\" parts. The overall picture thus becomes: ┌──────────────────────────────────┐ │ Gui (View + Controller) │ └──────────────────────────────────┘ ┌──────────────────────────────────┐ │ Model │ └──────────────────────────────────┘ In the traditional layered software approach this means: Code in the GUI can call any code, be it in Gui or Model. Code in the Model can only call the Model; it can not call the GUI Violating these rules typically leads to linker errors when linking the tests and/or opencpn-cmd targets. Typical Model parts are communication drivers, databases like routes and configuration data, various datatypes, plugin loading, etc. Having these in a model part means that they can be updated, tested and used without paying attention to the Gui as long as the interface is kept stable. This considerably simplifies code maintenance. At the time of writing, the Model is defined by the variable MODEL_SRC in the top level CMakeLists.txt. Remaining source file makes up the Gui. Work to make this more visible is likely to be done, for example by creating separate subdirectories like src/gui and src/model instead of a single src/ directory. From time to time Model code still needs to invoke the Gui. One example could be a communication driver which needs some user data which should be retrieved using a dialog box. Another example could be that the same driver needs to send a message to all plugins using the BroadcastToAllPlugins() method which currently resides in the Gui. There are three possible ways to handle this. Refactor the code so that the called method is moved to a Model component. Send an asynchronous signal to the Gui without any feedback. Use a callback. Of these, moving the code to the Model is generally a good thing if feasible. However, things like a dialog just cannot be moved, it will always have Gui dependencies. Otherwise, sending a signal is the simplest solution. It should be used when possible. The basic limitation is that this is an asynchronous fire-and-forget approach, the model will not get anything back from the Gui. If sending a signal does not fit the bill, a callback should be used. This is synchronous, and the Model can get a return value from the Gui Sending signals is done using an EventVar. This is declared in the observable_evtvar.h header file. The Model part defines and signals to the EventVar. The declaration is done in the header: #include \"observable_evtvar.h\" class ModelClass { public: /** Notified on SomeChange with a strinng available in GetString(). */ EventVar some_change; Note the comment, an EventVar without a comment is hard to track down. In the implementation file: void ModelClass::SomeMethod() { .... some_change;.Notify(\"this happened\"); ... } There are many overloads for Notify() which could be used to carry not only strings but also pointers, int/bool, etc. This is basically it from the Model perspective. One more more Gui component could listen to SomeChange, but this does not affect ModelClass. The Gui performs the listening. First, in the header declare an ObsListener #include \"model_class.h\" class GuiClassn { ... private: ObsListener some_change_listener; } And then, typically in the constructor, set up the listening in the implementation .cpp file: void GuiClass::GuiClass(ModelClass& model_class) { auto action = [&](ObservedEvt ev) { wxString s = ev.GetString(); do something useful } some_change_listener.Init(model_class.some_change, action); Here, GuiClass obviously needs to have access to an instance of ModelClass to be able to listen to it. In our case this is often a global variable, but this varies and could be more or less complicated. To use a callback, the model part defines it in a header, where there also is a accessor for the Gui to set it. The example assumes the function takes a string argument and returns a bool. This is just an example, the signature could be anything. #include ... class ModelClass { public: ModelClass::ModelClass() ; void SetCallback(std::function cb) { m_callback = cb; } private: std::function m_callback; } In the implementation .cpp file we first ensure that m_callback always have a defined, default value which basically does nothing without crashing ModelClass::ModelClass() : m_callback([](const std::string) { return false; }) { ... } It is now possible to invoke the callback and get the result from the Gui (assuming that SetCallback() has been called): ModelClass::SomeFunction() { ... bool result = m_callback(\"foo\"); ... } In the Gui the callback is set, typically using a lambda in the constructor like #include \"model_class.h\" ... GuiClass::GuiClass(ModelClass& model_class) { ... model_class.SetCallback([&](const std::string& s) { do something with s; return true or false; }); And that’s it. The model can now effectively call a function in the Gui without any knowledge of it. This upholds the basic promise that the model is not linked to the Gui in any way.","title":"GUI - model code organization","component":"opencpn-dev","version":"","name":"gui-model","url":"/opencpn-dev/gui-model.html","titles":[{"text":"Definition of the Gui and Model parts","hash":"_definition_of_the_gui_and_model_parts","id":1},{"text":"Model → Gui communication.","hash":"_model_gui_communication","id":2},{"text":"Using signals","hash":"_using_signals","id":3},{"text":"Using a callback","hash":"_using_a_callback","id":4}]},"56":{"id":56,"text":"Very little of the OpenCPN internals is documented, the docs here are just some sporadic notes on various spots in the code.

Debian .deb packages and Flatpaks are the primary deployment platforms for Linux. It is certainly possible to compile OpenCPN on other Linux distributions by adapting these instructions. The instructions are based on the files in the ci/ directory, at the time of writing ci/generic_build_debian.sh and ci/generic_build_flatpak.sh. These files which are continously tested is the ultimate source for how to build on Linux. $ git clone git://github.com/OpenCPN/OpenCPN.git $ cd OpenCPN $ sudo apt install devscripts equivs $ sudo mk-build-deps -i -r ci/control $ sudo apt-get --allow-unauthenticated install -f Notes: On old systems like Debian Buster and Ubuntu Bionic it is possible to build OpenCPN linked against gtk2 or gtk3. The default alternative is to use gtk3. The build setup is generally updated for Debian and Ubuntu LTS releases. $ sudo apt-get remove opencpn We’ll build everything in a subdirectory to keep the codebase clean (easier to catch changes). $ mkdir build $ cd build $ cmake .. $ make Notes: Default install dir is /usr/local, this can be changed by providing the appropriate option to cmake: $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr .. cmake is only required when building source code for the first time, then running make is enough even if the source code is updated. $ sudo make install Or, to create a .deb package: $ make package Install flatpak and flatpak-builder as described in https://flatpak.org/setup/. At the time of writing version 22.08 is used. Check flatpak/org.opencpn.OpenCPN.yaml for the version actually used, look for runtime-version:. Install the proper runtime and Sdk, for example: $ sudo flatpak install flathub org.freedesktop.Platform//22.08 $ sudo flatpak install flathub org.freedesktop.Sdk//22.08 $ cd build $ make -f ../flatpak/Makefile build The makefile will build the flatpak version and also install it. $ flatpak run org.opencpn.OpenCPN The flatpak’ed OpenCPN runs in a sandbox, so specialized debugging techniques must be applied. See The flatpak site From RPi 4 the board has resources enough to run a native build, which is performed according to the instructions for Debian. For RPi 3 with 1GB of ram builds are usually done utilizing cross-compiling on Linux, often using docker and, for 32-bit armhf builds, also qemu. A description of these builds is out of scope for this document. To install the dependencies required to build OpenCPN from source on Fedora (Tested on 38), run the following command: sudo dnf install wxGTK-devel cmake gcc-c++ git glew-devel openssl-devel \\ libcurl-devel libarchive-devel elfutils-libelf-devel redhat-lsb-core \\ libusb1-devel tinyxml-devel systemd-devel portaudio-devel libsndfile-devel \\ gtest-devel sqlite-devel rapidjson-devel Then use whichever build method you prefer. Visual Studio Code provides very decent support for C development. Install the language support for C, cmake and Git and open the root folder of the OpenCPN source tree. The current version has native support for cmake projects. It is thus possible to just create a new CMake project based on current sources out of the box. There is thus no need to use the unmaintained cmake -G \"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles\" ../ cmake project generation. However, this version suffers from https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=400073 which makes it impossible to index the sources. Without indexing, eclipse does not add that much value. Current version 5.6.2 has native support for CMake project. There is thus no need to use the unmaintained cmake -G \"KDevelop3 - Unix Makefiles\" ../ cmake project generation tools. The CLion IDE is currently used by some of the core project developers with good results. CLion is commercial software, but are giving out free licenses for open source development in certain cases. Initially, many of the dialogs was developed using wxFormBuilder. However, the sources has since long been patched \"manually\" and it is not possible to maintain them using this tool which basically has been abandoned in the project. In order to be able to run OpenCPN from inside the IDE installed data needs to be copied to the build/ folder according to $ cd build $ for d in gshhs s57data tcdata; do; cp -ar ../data/$d .; done $ mkdir uidata $ cp ../src/bitmaps/*.xml ../src/bitmaps/*.png ../src/bitmaps/*.svg uidata $ cp ../data/authors.html ../data/license.html . opencpn should be run with the -p options which sets it into 'portable' mode and therefore looks in the location the 'opencpn' executable is run from, i.e. the 'build' directory. Creating a working IDE setup is somewhat complex, and the details varies between different IDEs.","title":"Compiling on Linux","component":"opencpn-dev","version":"","name":"linux","url":"/opencpn-dev/linux.html","titles":[{"text":"Documented platforms","hash":"_documented_platforms","id":1},{"text":"Debian/Ubuntu","hash":"build_debian","id":2},{"text":"1.

This process will allow building single architecture binaries which are NOT compatible with the official OpenCPN packages and plugin built for them, but does not do modifications to the environment that might cause you problems while building other software. Such a setup is perfectly good for OpenCPN development. Install Xcode and the Command Line Tools for Xcode from the Apple Developer website (https://developer.apple.com/download/all/) Install Homebrew (https://brew.sh) Clone the OpenCPN source code (git clone https://github.com/OpenCPN/OpenCPN.git) Switch to the source tree (cd OpenCPN) Run the build script (ci/generic-build-macos.sh) The script installs additional tools and dependencies required to build OpenCPN and needs internet connection It is not necessary to run the script for subsequent builds, as all the dependencies are already installed, use the normal cmake workflow for them. The build products can be found in the build subdirectory This process is continuously tested by the OpenCPN automatic builds, so it is known to work. The generic-build-macos.sh is extensively commented, it’s strongly recommended to use it as reference while creating a build environment manually. Note that the official OpenCPN builds for macOS are created using a slightly different process implemented in universal-build-macos.sh to be repeatable, compatible with older macOS systems and to be able to produce universal binaries running natively on both Apple Silicon and Intel hardware. This process requires special set of dependencies that may conflict with other libraries on your system and you do not need it unless you intend to distribute your build product or use it with plugins from other developers available through the plugin manager. There are required development tools that can be installed via Homebrew (https://brew.sh) (or similarly from MacPorts, but it is unsupported and untested). Install Xcode and the Command Line Tools for Xcode from the Apple Developer website (https://developer.apple.com/download/all/) Install Homebrew: $ /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\" Install cmake and gettext via Homebrew: $ brew install cmake $ brew install gettext And either restart Terminal.app or reload your environment using ~/.bash_profile If you are building OpenCPN with extended archive support (default, required to download and unpack up to date GSHHG basemaps and pilot charts using the chart downloader plugin), libarchive library is needed, install it using: $ brew install zstd xz libarchive [Read following note - install only if necessary] - To produce binaries fully compatible with older macOS versions on newer macOS, libarchive must instead of from Homebrew, be built as follows: $ export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.13 $ wget https://libarchive.org/downloads/libarchive-3.3.3.tar.gz $ tar zxf libarchive-3.3.3.tar.gz $ cd libarchive-3.3.3 $ ./configure --without-lzo2 --without-nettle --without-xml2 --without-openssl --with-expat make $ make install $ cd .. OpenCPN is built upon wxWidgets, a package providing a cross-platform UI SDK. For local development the wxWidgets from Homebrew (or built locally) can be used: $ brew install wxwidgets But to get results fully compatible with the official OpenCPN builds, which retain compatibility with older macOS versions, wxWidgets must be version 3.2.5 built manually. For very old Intel machines you may download the prebuilt binaries archive from https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/nohal/opencpn-dependencies/raw/files/macos_deps_intel_legacy.tar.xz For modern Macs, OpenCPN is built as a universal binary against set of prebuilt dependencies available from https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/nohal/opencpn-dependencies/raw/files/macos_deps_universal-opencpn.tar.xz To build wxWidgets manually, you may use the following process: $ git clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 --branch v3.2.5 https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets.git $ cd wxWidgets $ mkdir build-release && cd build-release $ ../configure --with-cxx=11 --with-macosx-version-min=10.13 --enable-unicode --with-osx-cocoa --enable-aui --disable-debug --with-opengl --without-subdirs $ make -j2 $ sudo make install To create .pkg files for plugins, download the “Packages” tool from s.sudre.free.fr Install Packages.dmg by double-clicking the file and following the instructions - no need to open Packages.app as the installer configures the necessary command line tools for Packages. $ brew install --cask packages Officially OpenCPN is built from the command line, but it’s also possible to use Apple’s Xcode IDE for development. Regardless of which method we choose, the first steps are the same: Get the OpenCPN source: $ git clone https://github.com/OpenCPN/OpenCPN.git Create the build directory, where our local builds will take place, so that we don’t work directly in the source tree: $ mkdir OpenCPN/build && cd OpenCPN/build Build Method 1 - From the command line Prepare our build environment: $ export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.13 $ cmake .. Build OpenCPN: $ make To build a debug version use: $ export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.13 $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .. $ make Install OpenCPN: $ make install Build Method 2 - Using Xcode Create the Xcode project: $ export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.13 $ cmake -G Xcode .. Open the OpenCPN.xcodeproj file in Xcode, and use the “Build”, “Run”, “Debug”, etc features as normal. To use the “Run” action you need to build the “OpenCPN” target rather than the default “ALL_BUILD” target. WARNING - Do The Following: The default install location is (/usr/local/bin). Everything from /usr/local/bin gets packaged into your DMG which is not desirable. To avoid this, change the install location with 'cmake' as follows: $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/tmp .. Some developers have reported that the install step copies a redundant set of the wxWidgets dynamic library into the install directory, causing OpenCPN to fail. This is intended, but gets annoying for local bundles not intended to be distributed. A kludgey fix: $ sudo rm /usr/local/bin/OpenCPN.app/Contents/MacOS/libwx*dylib Build the installable PKG: $ make create-pkg Build the installable DMG: $ make create-dmg Depending on your local system, during both steps above you may observe insufficient permissions on some files. Either fix the permissions or use sudo to run make install/create-dmg Do not distribute binaries not built against the official dependencies, they will not be ABI compatible with the build products of other developers and will cause interoperability problems and confusion to the users.","title":"Compiling on macOS","component":"opencpn-dev","version":"","name":"mac-osx","url":"/opencpn-dev/mac-osx.html","titles":[{"text":"The fast track","hash":"_the_fast_track","id":1},{"text":"Development environment, detailed instructions","hash":"_development_environment_detailed_instructions","id":2},{"text":"Required external libraries","hash":"_required_external_libraries","id":3},{"text":"wxWidgets","hash":"_wxwidgets","id":4},{"text":"Packages tool","hash":"_packages_tool","id":5},{"text":"Building OpenCPN","hash":"_building_opencpn","id":6},{"text":"Creating the installer package","hash":"_creating_the_installer_package","id":7}]},"59":{"id":59,"text":"/** \\file msg_listen.h Plugin message listening helper class. */ #include #include #include #include \"ocpn_plugin.h\" /** * Helper class for setting up message listening in plugins. * Example usage: * MsgListener listener * ... * auto action = [&] (ObservedEvt ev) { * auto payload = GetN0183Payload(NMEA0183Id(\"GGA\"), ev); * ... * }; * listener.Init(NMEA0183Id(\"GGA\"), action); */ template(typename T) class MsgListener : public wxEvtHandler { public: MsgListener() = default; void Init(T id, std::function action) { const wxEventTypeTag EvtObs(wxNewEventType()); m_listener = GetListener(id, EvtObs, this); Bind(EvtObs, action); } private: std::shared_ptr m_listener; };","title":"","component":"opencpn-dev","version":"","name":"msg_listen","url":"/opencpn-dev/msg_listen.html","titles":[]},"60":{"id":60,"text":"There are two methods of interacting programatically with Ocpn_Draw_pi (OD), json messages via the OpenCPN message procees and binary, exposed API. All interactions have to start with a json message to ascertain critical information abou the API, after this json messages can continue to be used or access to the binary API can be sought. For all interactions there will always be the json messages, but for performance the binary API is preferred if it is usable. Both API’s uses the same information and for simplicity in the descriptions the json message will be used. Currently the OD API is used by: Watchdog_pi (WD) Weather_routing_pi (WR) Squiddio_pi (SQ) Testplugin_pi (TP, FE2) TP and FE2 refer to the same plugin but for two different purposes. TP is for testing the OD API, it can also be used as a template to create another pluign as it is complete and interacts with all the required OCPN API’s to establish a toolbar icon, have preferences in the main settings/plugins tab for the plugin and to use the OD API. FE2 is the name given to plugin when used for the templated build environment which trys to simplify the whole build process. The template allows local builds and installs for initial builds, testing and changes. It also gives a build process which will generate packages for all the currrent supported environments and create the cloudsmith objects that allow yourself and others to install and test the plugin. WD and WR both use the binary API if it is available, SQ only uses the json API as it is used infrequently. TP uses the binary API exclusively apart from the initial contact with OD which uses the json API. The binary API assumes that the caller has all the correct information as there are no checks on the parameters passed. The json API uses a json schema to check for validity so can be more robust of the two. It is important to understand that OD only provides the information about geo-referenced objects (lines, points, straight lined areas and circles), or allows though the API’s the management of these objects. The plugins using the API know what they are trying todo with this information. So WD knows when and how to sound alarms, WR knows what to do with areas that are exclusions and builds appropriate routes, and SQ knows about location information which it loads into OD through the API so it can be displayed, but SQ has the information which is used. Ocpn_Draw and Watchdog User aspects In OD, a graphical indication (crosshatching or shading) may be added to areas, to indicate whether these are intended to avoid (crosshatched inside) or to stay within (crosshatched outside), or whatever other meaning you want to give to those graphical indications. In WD you can select whether (certain types of) alarms should react only for areas that are flagged (in OD) as to avoid or to stay within, or for all areas. On top of that, in WD you can indicate whether this should be done only for areas labeled in OD as active, or inactive, or both. The WD Boundary Alarm has 4 different types: Alarm when approaching an area from outside (based on distance); Alarm when approaching an area from outside (based on time); Alarm to indicate whether your boat is inside or outside an area (Inclusion Alarm, another type of anchor alarm); Alarm to indicate whether AIS objects are present in an area. For the first two alarms the WD uses the same terms for the boundary that OD does as well as allowing a check for the state of the boundary. The third alarm only looks at a specific boundary which is identified by the boundaries GUID. The fourth alarm specifies a boundary to check if an AIS target is inside it. Beside the 4 types of Boundary Alarms mentioned above, WD has the following alarm functionality: Alarm when approaching coastlines (Landfall AFirst of all, we should see OD and WD as separate plugins. In OD you can draw geo-referenced objects (lines, points, straight lined areas and circles). WD knows when and how to sound alarms. +larm; 2 types: time and distance) Alarm when NMEA-data stream stops (NMEA Alarm) Deadman Alarm Alarm when distance to reference position exceeds a set value (Anchor Alarm) Alarm when course over ground deviates more than set (Course Alarm; 3 types: only port deviation, only starboard deviation or a general deviation); Alarms when speed deviates more then set (Speed Alarm; two types: overspeed for more than set maximum, and underspeed for less than set minimum).First of all, we should see OD and WD as separate plugins. In OD you can draw geo-referenced objects (lines, points, straight lined areas and circles). WD knows when and how to sound alarms. In total there are 14 different types of alarms. Technical aspects WD and OD are independent plugins. OD knows about drawing geo-referenced objects, WD knows how to sound alarms. Now the two can work together by passing and receiving messages, in this case JSON messages (basically a text string of elements and values), or by using the binary API provided. For the alarms, when WD needs boundary information, WD asks OD, via a message, whether a Lat/Lon is inside a boundary. WD can add further requirements asking for boundaries in a particular state and a particular type. Both the state and type are the same as what OD uses, i.e. Active/Inactive and Exclusion/Inclusion/Neither, or the inclusive 'Any' (meaning any type and/or any state, not being as selective). In OD the boundaries checked are both an OD Boundary and an OD Boundary Point with range rings showing. Boundaries and Boundary Point Range Rings are both considered boundaries. The type of boundary applies to both, but the state (active/inactive) currently only applies to Boundaries, not Boundary Points. This is because there is currently no state for a Boundary Point. This may change in future updates to the plugins for consistency. When OD completes its check of Lat/Lon inside boundaries it replies with a single message containing the first boundary that the Lat/Lon is inside AND which matches the type and state requested. The response message contains the Name, Description, GUID, Type and State of the boundary found. WD uses the returned message to decide whether to sound the alarm and uses some of the information in the messages that are then displayed to the user, i.e. a change in text in the watchdog window and a message box, if requested. Messaging in OCPN is synchronous, broadcast such that every plugin that registers for messages and the main program, OpenCPN, will receive every message sent. All processing of messages is synchronous, i.e. each plugin has to process each message completely and return to OCPN (the controller) before the next plugin can process the message. For the WD/OD message stream WD sends a message to OD, OD processes the message and sends a response message to WD, WD mainline processes the response message and stores the information, then returns control to OD which then returns control to WD at the point that WD created the first message. Now WD can process the saved information from OD, and the controller, OpenCPN can process the next message. OD messages can be used by any plugin and OCPN itself to obtain information. For the OD messaging there is a “structure” for the content of the message, specifying the source requester, the type of message (Request/Response), the message i.e. FindPointInAnyBoundary, the message id (may contain an identifier for the source requester) and then the message contents, i.e. Lat, Lon, Type, etc. So a request looks like: Source: \"WATCHDOG_PI\" Type: \"Request\" Msg: \"FindPointInAnyBoundary\" MsgId: \"distance\" lat: 54.0001 lon: -30.1001 BoundaryType: \"Exclusion\" BoundaryState: \"Active\" This message is then given a 'destination', in this case \"OCPN_DRAW_PI\", when the call to the OCPN messaging process is made. The response will look like: Source: \"OCPN_DRAW_PI\" Type: \"Response\" Msg: \"FindPointInAnyBoundary\" MsgId: \"distance\" GUID: \"62ec7520-b58f-4087-b077-ae1c581dfec1\" lat: 54.0001 lon: -30.1001 Name: \"Rocks\" Description: \"Good fishing\" Found: false BoundaryObjectType: \"Boundary\" BoundaryType: \"Exclusion\" This message is then given a “destination” of the originator, in the case above \"WATCHDOG_PI\", when the call to the OCPN messaging process is made. The “destination” is used so that each recipient of the broadcast message can easily check if the message is meant for it. There is no filtering provided by OCPN messaging on this value. Using this construct there are validation checks to make sure messages are valid to process. If they are not valid there will be error messages entered into the \"opencpn.log\" file with relevant information. Currently this message construct is used by OD, WD, WR (Ocpn_Draw_pi, Watchdog_pi, Weather_Routing_pi) and the AIS processing in OCPN when it broadcasts AIS information to OCPN and the plugins. In some cases there is no response message expected, i.e. AIS just sends messages, but in others the response is important. OD is not concerned where the message came from or why, it will just respond to message requests with what is found from inspection of OD objects. WD just wants to know if it should sound an alarm or not, so it sends message requests to OD to determine certain conditions. WR just wants to know if the current Lat/Lon is valid for further processing or not, so it sends message requests to OD to determine certain conditions. AIS just provides information on each target it is dealing with. Now the check frequency in the WD alarm screen determines how often to check for a Lat/Lon being in a boundary. One other item which should be mentioned, is that for each boundary check based on time there are up to 11 Lat/Lon messages sent to OD, for each distance check there are up to 163 Lat/Lon messages to OD. Therefore the amount of this message traffic is something to watch. Please note that a JSON message does not have a “structure” per se, the message consists of element/value pairs written as delimited strings. The elements can occur in any order. So “structure” in the sense used in this document really refers to required elements. API Definitions There is an API json definition and an API binary header file available in opencpn-libs/odapi, * ODJSONSchemas.h * ODAPI.h The ODJSONSchemas.h contains the definition against which the input json message will be validated. If the validation fails the json message will be rejected. The ODAPI.h should be included in any cpp file that you are going to use to call the OD binary API. It gives all the definitions for the calls and expected contents of the parameter lists and return parameter lists. For and example of how these calls are structured you can look in the three current plugins that make use of the API, or you can look in testplugin_pi which was used in the development of this API and is also the base for the Front End 2 (FE2) build process for plugins.","title":"API","component":"opencpn-dev","version":"","name":"odraw-messaging","url":"/opencpn-dev/odraw-messaging.html","titles":[]},"61":{"id":61,"text":"Since 5.8.0 opencpn has a new system for handling messages in plugins. The new model is based on that a plugin subscribes to the messages it is interested in rather then the old model where plugins get all messages. The new system is the only way to handle the new NMEA2000 devices. For N0183 devices a compatiblity layer is installed which makes things work as earlier. However, the new system can be used also for nmea0183 where it offers more flexibility and performance. Receiving messages is done in six steps: Define the type of message to work with Declare a listening object. Declare an event which will carry the message. Declare a method which handles the message. Subscribe to this message i. e., start listening to it Handle the messages as they arrives. The code handling messages must live in a wxEventClass instance. In almost all cases this means that the code should be implemented in a wxWindow. If there is a wxWindow available with a suitable lifespan, this could be used. If there is no such window, it needs to be created (it can be hidden) or an existing one can be modified to alwasy exist, using Show()/Hide() to enable and disable. As an example, the ShipDrivergui_impl class is used. First, in the header declare a listener on the class level, here with the shipdriver plugin ShipDrivergui_impl.h header as an example: class Dlg : public ShipDriverBase { public: ... private: ② std::shared_ptr listener; ... Then, in the implementation (.cpp) file declare a method which handles the message, something like this: ④ static void HandleGPGA(ObservedEvt ev) { ① NMEA0183 id(\"GPGGA\"); std::string payload = GetN0183Payload(id, ev) ... Then, still in the .cpp file, set up the listening in the window constructor: Dlg::Dlg(wxWindow* parent, ...) { ... ① NMEA0183Id id(\"GPGGA\"); ③ wxDEFINE_EVENT(EVT_SHIPDRIVER, ObservedEvt); ⑤ listener = GetListener(id, EVT_SHIPDRIVER, this); ⑥ Bind(EVT_SHIPDRIVER, [&](ObservedEvt ev) { HandleGPGA(ev); }); Notes: ① This is the type of message we are listening to. There are similar types for NMEA2000, SignalK and decoded navigation data (lat, long, etc.). Check ocpn_plugin.h for details. ② Boiler-plate code, makes sure the listener is destroyed together with the plugin. It is important that the listener is declared in the class, a variable defined in a method will not work. ③ This is the event generated for our message which we will listen to. It should have a unique name, including the plugin name is a good habit. However the name, here EVT_SHIPDRIVER, could be anything. ④ The GetN0183Payload() method gets the payload of the message into the payload string. From here it can be processed as required. There are similar methods for Nmea2000 and SignalK messages (signalK from upcoming 5.10.0). ⑤ This activates the listener. From this point system sends us an EVT_SHIPDRIVER for each received GPGGA message. ⑥ This is the final piece in the puzzle. It defines what should happen when the EVT_SHIPDRIVER arrives. From this point all incoming GPGGA messages will land in the HandleGPGGA() method and be processed. The workflow above means quite a lot of typing for each message. Using a helper class can automate a lot of this. An example class called MsgListener is provided here. With this class available in a header listening to a message is simplified to Declare a MsgListener listener object Declare a method which handles the message. Initiate the listener to invoke the method when message arrives. The MsgListener object normally lives in the class context, like: class Dlg : public ShipDriverBase { public: ... private: MsgListener listener; ... Other available types includes MsgListener and MsgListener The method is declared as above: static void HandleGPGA(ObservedEvt ev) { NMEA0183Id id(\"GPGGA\"); std::string payload = GetN0183Payload(id, ev) ... Similar methods exist to extract NMEA2000 and SignalK data: GetN2000Payload(NMEA2000Id id, ObservedEvt ev) and GetSignalkPayload(ObservedEvt ev). To invoke this method when a GPGGA message arrives, initiate the MsgListener like: listener.Init(NMEA0183Id(\"GPGGA\"), [&](ObservedEvt ev) { HandleGPGA(ev); }); The last step above was Bind(EVT_SHIPDRIVER [](wxCommandEvent ev) { HandleGPGA(ev); }). The part between the curly braces is actually a C++ lambda expression. There is no need to dive into this to get something running, but it offers far larger possibilities than to just call a function. Actually, if written like Bind(EVT_SHIPDRIVER, [&](wxCommandEvent ev) { …​ }) any code could be written between the braces. The interesting part here is that the [&] prefix makes this code \"see\" anything defined in the plugin. This is a convenient way to access plugin variables in the handler, something which otherwise is a problem. To get the feeling one need to experiment. But then again, C++ lambdas is a complex step which is not necessary to get something running. Handling signalk messages goes like auto payload = GetSignalkPayload(ev); const auto msg = *std::static_pointer_cast(payload); msg is a const json map containing at least \"Data\": the parsed json message. \"ErrorCount\": int, the number of parsing errors. \"WarningCount\": int, the number of parsing warnings. \"Errors\": list of strings, error messages. \"Warnings\": list of strings, warning messages. \"Context\": string, message context. \"ContextSelf\": string, own ship context. Since the map is const, expressions like msg[\"Data\"] are not possible (the [] operator is not const since it potentially inserts data into the map if the index does not exist). Use msg.ItemAt(\"Data\") instead. Plugin API supporting direct access to comm drivers for output purposes Plugins may access comm ports for direct output. The general program flow for a plugin may look something like this pseudo-code: Plugin will query OCPN core for a list of active comm drivers. Plugin will inspect the list, and query OCPN core for driver attributes. Plugin will select a comm driver with appropriate attributes for output. Plugin will register a list of PGNs expected to be transmitted (N2K specific) Plugin may then send a payload buffer to a specific comm driver for output as soon as possible. The mechanism for specifying a particular comm driver uses the notion of \"handles\". Each active comm driver has an associated opaque handle, managed by OCPN core. All references by a plugin to a driver are by means of its handle. Handles should be considered to be \"opaque\", meaning that the exact contents of the handle are of no specific value to the plugin, and only have meaning to the OCPN core management of drivers. Some example code sending payload_msg to the /dev/ttyUSB0 port: using namespace std; string payload_msg(\"$GPRMC, some data \\r\\n\"); string my_port(\"/dev/ttyUSB0\"); for (const auto& handle : GetActiveDrivers()) { const auto& attributes = GetAttributes(handle); if (attributes.find(\"protocol\") == attributes.end()) continue; if (attributes.at(\"protocol\") != \"nmea0183\") continue; if (attributes.find(\"commPort\") == attributes.end()) continue; if (attributes.at(\"commPort\").find(my_port) == string::npos) continue; auto payload = make_shared>(); for (const auto& ch : payload_msg) payload->push_back(ch); CommDriverResult result = WriteCommDriver(handle, payload); return result; } return RESULT_COMM_INVALID_PARMS; // no such driver","title":"Handling Communications Messages in Plugins","component":"opencpn-dev","version":"","name":"plugin-messaging","url":"/opencpn-dev/plugin-messaging.html","titles":[{"text":"Receiving messages","hash":"_receiving_messages","id":1},{"text":"Simplified workflow using a helper class","hash":"_simplified_workflow_using_a_helper_class","id":2},{"text":"Epilog: Using the lambda","hash":"_epilog_using_the_lambda","id":3},{"text":"Receiving SignalK messages","hash":"_receiving_signalk_messages","id":4},{"text":"Sending messages","hash":"_sending_messages","id":5}]},"62":{"id":62,"text":"The plugin API is defined by On Linux and MacOS The file ocpn_plugin.h On MSVC Windows ocpn_plugin.h and the opencpn.lib import lib On mingw Windows builds ocpn_plugin.h and the libopencpn.dll.a import lib The API Designation is found in the ocpn_plugin.h file: #define MY_API_VERSION_MAJOR 1 #define MY_API_VERSION_MINOR 16 The API is intended to be backwards compatible, and has stayed so since at least 10 years.

On Flatpak, runtime updates will inevitably also create ABI breaks. The Main program API number is distinct and independent from the OpenCPN Version number.

On a normal non-portable installation it listens on port 8443. The interface is documented in the file model/include/model/rest_server.h, also available in the manual at http://opencpn.github.io/OpenCPN/api-docs/classAbstractRestServer.html. In order to establish trust between a client and a server a pairing scheme is used. It works like this: Client sends the key it has for server (if any) to it. Server validates the key. If ok, all is done. In response to a bad key server generates a new key for the client. A numeric pincode corresponding to the key is presented in the server GUI. User reads pincode at server GUI and inputs it in client GUI. Client stores key for server. Rinse and repeat. The basic idea is that user needs to have physical access to both the server and the client GUI to perform the pairing. This is experimental code available from 5.9+. You have been warned. The requirement to have access to both the server and client GUI is cumbersome when working with a headless server. In these cases it might be possible to make headless pairing using ssh. Prerequisites: The client needs to have access to the server without using a password, usually configured using ssh-copy-id. Instructions for this is out of scope for this document. The server needs have opencpn installed so that it is available on PATH. In particular, opencpn-cmd should be accessible from the shell. In order for ssh to work the server needs a fixed IP address. The primary use case is a headless Raspberry pie server i. e., a Linux one. The actual command required to run ssh varies, example here is ssh raspbian, YMMV. Steps: ① $ opencpn-cmd print-hostname hemulen ② $ ssh raspbian opencpn-cmd generate-key hemulen 4781 ③ $ ssh raspbian opencpn-cmd print-hostname raspbian ④ $ opencpn-cmd store-key raspbian 4781 ① Check the name for the local host using opencpn-cmd print-hostname on the client. ② Run ssh opencpn-cmd generate-key . Substitute with the name obtained in ①. The command prints a pincode on stdout. ③ Run ssh opencpn-cmd print-hostname. This prints a hostname on stdout. ④ Run opencpn-cmd store-key . Substitute with the pincode obtained in ②. and with hostname from ③. First look up the key in the config file.

OTOH, the descriptions for Debian/Ubuntu and Flatpak are usable at the time of writing. Occasionally, if OpenCPN crashes a stack trace carries valuable information about the crash which often is needed to find out the reason. The procedure to create a stack trace is depends on platform, but the general steps are Install necessary tools Download or install debug symbols. Start opencpn controlled by a debugger and make it crash Display the stack trace in the debugger and submit it in a bug report The tool to use is windbg. It is part of a large set of debugging tools, but can be installed separately as described in https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/debugger-download-tools Debugging symbols in Windows are contained in a pdb file. Pdb files for OpenCPN can be downloaded from the latest github release artifacts directory, currently https://github.com/OpenCPN/OpenCPN/releases/tag/Release_5.8.4. This file should be downloaded and installed in the same directory as OpenCPN, by default C:\\Program Files (x86)\\OpenCPN\\. After installing windbg, start it after typing windbg in the bottom-left Windows search bar. Use the 32-bit x86 variant for user-space code if there are alternatives. In windbg, use File | Open Executable to open the opencpn program. In a default installation, it can be found in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\OpenCPN\\opencpn.exe. Opencpn starts executing, but stops at an very early stage. This is normal. The pane at the bottom of windbg is a command window. Here, give the command g followed by a return. OpenCPN then resumes execution. Make the actions which triggers a crash. After the crash put focus on windbg again. In the command window, give the command kp followed by a return.

Notes: If OpenCPN hasn’t been started before (fresh installation) one needs to first open it using ctrl-right-click in order to work around unsigned developer checks. Watch out for error messages when loading symbol file (target symbols add). If possible, resize OpenCPN so it does not cover the command window — the command window does not become on top after the crash causing an interesting situation. After the crash, control returns to the debugger. Here, give the command bt which displays the trace. Copy the first 10-20 lines and submit in a bug report. : The first step on Debian and Ubuntu is to install debug symbols, see above. This can be done using either using debuginfod or by installing the opencpn-dbgsym package. Using debuginfod is simple and works almost the same way in Ubuntu and Debian. It creates a stacktrace with symbols for all files involved (for example wxWidgets), not only opencpn. The drawback is a large, gigabyte download. Installing a debug package is somewhat more complicated, but avoids the large debuginfod download. It only provides debug symbols for openpcn, but this is usually all that is required. The package installation differs between Ubuntu and Debian To use debuginfod on Debian run before invoking gdb: $ export DEBUGINFOD_URLS=\"https://debuginfod.debian.net\" On Ubuntu, use: $ export DEBUGINFOD_URLS=\"https://debuginfod.ubuntu.com\" See also: https://wiki.debian.org/Debuginfod Add to /etc/apt/sources.list a line like below, adjusting bullseye to the actual distribution used : deb http://deb.debian.org/debian-debug/ bullseye-debug main Then install the package using $ sudo apt update $ sudo apt install opencpn-dbgsym If you installed the opencpn package from the official Ubuntu repositories, use these instructions Create a file named /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ddebs.list like below, substituting jammy with the actual distribution like bionic or focal. deb http://ddebs.ubuntu.com jammy main restricted universe multiverse deb http://ddebs.ubuntu.com jammy-updates main restricted universe multiverse deb http://ddebs.ubuntu.com jammy-proposed main restricted universe multiverse Import the debug symbol archive signing key from the Ubuntu server using $ sudo apt install ubuntu-dbgsym-keyring and install package using $ sudo apt update $ sudo apt install opencpn-dbgsym See also: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Debug%20Symbol%20Packages If you installed the opencpn package from the Launchpad PPA of the OpenCPN development team, use these instructions Add the following line to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opencpn-ubuntu-opencpn-jammy.list deb https://ppa.launchpadcontent.net/opencpn/opencpn/ubuntu/ jammy main/debug and install package using $ sudo apt update $ sudo apt install opencpn-dbgsym","title":"Creating a stack trace","component":"opencpn-dev","version":"","name":"stacktrace","url":"/opencpn-dev/stacktrace.html","titles":[{"text":"Windows","hash":"_windows","id":1},{"text":"Install windbg","hash":"_install_windbg","id":2},{"text":"Download pdb file","hash":"_download_pdb_file","id":3},{"text":"Start OpenCPN and make it crash","hash":"_start_opencpn_and_make_it_crash","id":4},{"text":"Display stack trace and submit it.","hash":"_display_stack_trace_and_submit_it","id":5},{"text":"Note for developers:","hash":"_note_for_developers","id":6},{"text":"Debian/Ubuntu","hash":"debian-trace","id":7},{"text":"Flatpak","hash":"_flatpak","id":8},{"text":"MacOS","hash":"_macos","id":9},{"text":"Install the lldb debugger","hash":"_install_the_lldb_debugger","id":10},{"text":"Download and install debug symbols","hash":"_download_and_install_debug_symbols","id":11},{"text":"Start debugging","hash":"_start_debugging","id":12},{"text":"Display the stack trace","hash":"_display_the_stack_trace","id":13},{"text":"Debian/Ubuntu debug symbols","hash":"debian-debugsyms","id":14},{"text":"Using debuginfod.","hash":"_using_debuginfod","id":15},{"text":"Installing debug package on Debian","hash":"_installing_debug_package_on_debian","id":16},{"text":"Installing debug package on Ubuntu","hash":"_installing_debug_package_on_ubuntu","id":17},{"text":"Installing debug package from the Launchpad PPA","hash":"_installing_debug_package_from_the_launchpad_ppa","id":18}]},"65":{"id":65,"text":"For trouble shooting and lower level nitty gritty details, the command line, configuration files and debuggers are your friends. $ ./opencpn --help Usage: opencpn -h | --help opencpn [-p] [-f] [-G] [-g] [-P] [-l ] [-u ] [-U] [-s] [GPX file ...] opencpn --remote [-R] | -q] | -e] |-o ] Options for starting opencpn -c, --configdir= Use alternative configuration directory. -p, --portable Run in portable mode. -f, --fullscreen Switch to full screen mode on start. -G, --no_opengl Disable OpenGL video acceleration.

OpenCPN uses wxWidgets, currently version 3.2.x on Linux packages, and 3.2.5 for other platforms. See wxWidgets Reference Manuals wxWidgets uses a tick-tock release schedule where even-numbered versions are stable including a stable ABI. Odd-numbered version are unstable, development versions. On Linux platforms OpenCPN normally uses the current stable version, at the time of writing 3.2. This is partly a practical issue since conservative distributions like Debian don’t package unstable, odd versions. One other platforms unstable, odd versions are occasionally used. Changing wxWidgets version leads to a ABI break for plugins, which must be re-compiled against the new version. However, wxWidgets has strong ABI compatiblity promise for minor updates, so for example updating from 3.2.3 to 3.2.4 should not affect plugins as long as nothing which only exists in 3.2.4 is used.

The coverage is not high, but they can still be useful. The methods to invoke them depends on platform. On all platform the tests are built using the build target test After a successful build of the overall program, the unit tests are created using make test. The simplest way to run the test is from the build directory: $ cd build $ make test $ make run-tests This provides a good overview over all tests available and the results. If there is a need of more fine-grained operation, the basic tests are available in the build/test directory. Here, there is a number of executables like tests, rest-tests and ipc-tests. Each of these can be run and will then provide more detailed output. For example tests --help provides info on available command line options. There is for example options to only run a single test, avoiding certain test(s), etc. After a successful build of the program, tests are built by building the test target. This could (probably) be done in VS Studio or on the command line: % cd build % cmake --build . --config Release --target test The tests are created in a directory like build\\test\\, for example build\\test\\Release. To be able to run, libraries needs to be installed into the same directory using something like % cd build % cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:/Users/al/src/OpenCPN/build/test/Release .. % cmake --install . The CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX path is the absolute path to the test directory; obviously this will be different for every user. With the libraries in place the test overview could be run like % cd build % cmake --build . --config Release --target run-tests If there is a need to get more detailed feedback the basic test executables like rest-tests, ipc-tests and tests can be run from the installation directory.

Which tools appear in the toolbar. The size and background of the chart status bar. The background of the active route window. When OpenCPN starts it will look for files named styleXXX.xml (where the XXX means that any text is allowed here) in the uidata subdirectory of the installation, and also in the user settings directory (** ~/.opencpn *under Linux). Each style.xml file defines one or several styles. The overall structure of the file should look like this: All bitmaps that the style needs are defined in a PNG file, which is named in the * ** tag. The various tags refer to bitmap locations in this file. Locations are in X/Y coordinates with the upper left corner as (0,0) and with positive Y downwards. This file should be a 24 bit PNG. Transparency is fully supported, you can use semitransparent icons and backgrounds to combine various effects. The tag contains overall parameters for the and versions of the toolbar. This makes it possible to have non-square buttons and still have the toolbar nicely rendered in both orientations. The separation distance is the separation in pixels between two toolbar buttons. When using non-square buttons the tool icon might have different positions on the background for horizontal and vertical. In this case, position the icons correctly for the horizontal case, and then specify the offset for the vertical case using the tag where X/Y are in pixels and are allowed to be negative. The margins are the margins around the outside, measured in pixels. The margin can also be made transparent. With a transparent toolbar the window edge snap will have a space between the window edge and the buttons. and should provide two different backgrounds, one for the non-toggled and one for the toggled (or pressed) state of the button. The toggled background is allowed to be larger (but not smaller) than the no-toggled. If you use this feature, make sure to specify enough spacing and margins to render the larger background properly. The tag specifies a default size for tools, but this can be overridden for an individual tool in its own tag. The toolbar can be further styled with nice looking start and end images using the tags. These are drawn on top of the other graphics. The tag allows you to specify the corner radius of the toolbar. NB! Rounded corners are only visible if you use transparent margins. is an item in the toolbar. It should provide three icons: A \"normal\" one plus the rolled over and disabled states.

Cursors and waypoint markers are examples of this type of icon. It has only one state. The standard OpenCPN tools have names, which you can easily get by looking at one of the default installed styles. Plug-ins are styled based on their \"common name\". If your style provides a tool for the plug-in, that will have priority over any icons provided by the plugin itself. But for plug-ins that use their icons as a means of communicating status, the plug-ins icon will again get priority.

The fast track described here is simplified and without all the options provided by the procedure described from next section. To set up a complete directly usable local development environment, you should probably prefer the workflow implemented by the winConfig.bat script described in the next chapter. Steps to to make a build: Get Visual Studio Community 2022, either the command line tools or the complete environment, from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/ Install the choco package manager, https://chocolatey.org/install Clone the sources and move into them: > git clone https://github.com/OpenCPN/OpenCPN.git > cd OpenCPN Run the script buildwin\\win_deps.bat. First time script installs programs and should be invoked with administrative privileges using the Visual Studio Command Line Interface. Following runs can (i. e., should) be run as a regular user. Run the script ci\\appveyor.bat. This will configure the project using cmake and make an initial build. After the first build, new builds can be done using in the build directory using: > cmake --build . --target opencpn --config Release Notes: --target opencpn creates the main executable. Other targets which can be built include --target opencpn-cmd — Command line tool --target opencpn-glutil — Command line tool for testing OpenGL capabilities of the system (The opencpn-glutil.exe build product is required in the runtime folder for OpenGL to work) --target tests — Command line unit tests --target package — NSIS installer It is perfectly possible to use --config Debug to create an executable with debugging symbols etc. However, doing so will make the plugins in the catalog incompatible as it is not possible to load optimized libraries into an opencpn debug build. Prefer RelWithDebInfo configuration in most cases. win_deps.bat stores files in the cache directory. This can be removed safely, it is re-created from scratch by win_deps.bat The correct options to invoke cmake manually can be found in ci\\appveyor.bat Both win_deps.bat and appveyor.bat are used in the ci builds and should thus be reasonably tested. However, user environment (in particular PATH)) can make them fail. The steps here describe an alternative to the \"Fast Track\" scenario above. It is much simpler to make a complete build in Visual Studio, including full source debugging with Intellisense®. Quick start: From the Windows Desktop open x86 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022 (or 2019). Then enter these 4 commands: $ git clone https://github.com/opencpn/opencpn $ cd opencpn $ \".\\buildwin\\winConfig.bat\" $ \".\\build\\opencpn.sln\" When Visual Studio opens, select the desired build configuration (Debug, Release, etc.) and you are ready to edit and build. Click the Debug button to build and open OpenCPN in the VS debugger. Here are more details with explanations of each step. Install Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/. Be sure to select components: Desktop development with C++ C++ CMake tools for windows Install git for Windows: https://git-scm.com/download/win Open x86 Native Tools Command Prompt for Visual Studio 2022 Create folder where you want to work with OpenCPN sources, something like this: $ mkdir \\Users\\myname\\projects $ cd \\Users\\myname\\projects Clone Opencpn, for example: $ cd \\Users\\myname\\projects $ git clone https://github.com/opencpn/opencpn Configure and build OpenCPN then open solution file in Visual Studio: $ cd opencpn $ \".\\buildwin\\winConfig.bat\" $ \".\\build\\opencpn.sln\" Now you can browse the code, run & debug OpenCPN from Visual Studio. Select the desired build configuration (Debug, Release, etc.) and click the Debug button. After you close Visual Studio and the command prompt you can return to Visual Studio using just 2 commands. From an x86 Native Tools Command Prompt run: $ \".\\buildwin\\configDev.bat\" $ \".\\build\\opencpn.sln\" Notes: Managed plugins are only supplied as Release builds. Thus, if you want to debug OpenCPN when any managed plugins are installed, you must debug OpenCPN in Release or RelWithDebInfo mode. If you build your own plugin in Debug configuration, then you can debug both OpenCPN and your plugin at the same time using the same Visual Studio Debug session. You can use msbuild as the command line builder instead of CMake. The reasons for doing so are: msbuild is faster than CMake or CMake w/Ninja msbuild gives full access to every type of build and project We also recommend installing the latest powershell version. It is more powerful and visually friendly. Install like this: $ winget install --id Microsoft.Powershell --source winget It is important to have a 'clean' environment. Make sure there are no permanent environment variables related to wxWidgets (these all begin with WX). If you have any it is safe to delete them. Remove all references to wxWidgets from the permanent PATH environment variables. It is ok to install tools such as NSIS but not required. Any tools required to build or package will be automatically installed by the 'buildwin\\winConfig.bat' script. The 'winConfig.bat' script does not install Visual Studio. Neither does it install tools such as git or npm as these are not used by the build system. The 'winConfig.bat' script sets up 4 folders beneath the 'build' folder that house 4 different runtime configurations based on the 4 standard build types. Since each configuration is a standalone local instance of OpenCPN, they have to be run in 'portable' mode. To manually launch a particular configruation (e.g. RelWithDebInfo) set the working folder to OpenCPN\\build\\RelWithDebInfo then launch OpenCPN in portable mode. For example: $ cd OpenCPN $ \".\\buildwin\\configdev.bat\" $ cd \".\\build\\RELWITHDEBINFO\" $ \".\\opencpn\" -p The 'winConfig.bat' script also has the ability to automatically clean before building. The full list of command line options are as follows: --clean :: clean and reinitialize the build folder --rebuild :: rebuild all sources --help :: print helpful text --relwithdebinfo :: build relwithdebinfo configuration --debug :: build debug configuration --release :: build release configuration --minsizerel :: build release configuration --all :: setup and build all four standard configurations (this is the default) Useful msbuild command line examples follow. Type these commands after running '.\\buildwin\\configdev.bat' from the root opencpn git managed folder. Clean and build entire OpenCPN project to create debug build $ cd build $ msbuild /m -t:Rebuild -p:Configuration=Debug opencpn.sln Build Release version of the installer package $ cd build $ msbuild /v:m /m -p:Configuration=Release PACKAGE.vcxproj Clean and build every project as a Release build with debug info $ cd build $ msbuild /m -t:Rebuild -p:Configuration=RelWithDebInfo All_BUILD.vcxproj Build debug version of OpenCPN core $ cd build $ msbuild /m -t:Build -p:Configuration=Debug opencpn.vcxproj Clean opencpn-cmd.exe $ cd build $ msbuild /m -t:Clean -p:Configuration=Debug opencpn-cmd.vcxproj Clean and build chart downloader plugin $ cd build $ msbuild /m -t:Rebuild -p:Configuration=Debug plugins\\chartdldr_pi\\chartdldr_pi.vcxproj You can use still use CMake if you like. This example will build a Windows installer executable with debug configuration. This can be useful to find otherwise hidden debug asserts. $ cd build $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\OpenCPN\" .. $ cmake --build . --config Debug --target Package This will clean and build a Release build $ cd build $ cmake --build . --config Release --clean-first It is possible to attach the Visual Studio debugger to a running instance. This is useful if you create an installer, install and run OpenCPN from the start menu. Once OpenCPN is running in its native enviroment the Visual Studio debugger can attach itself to the running instance. Find Attach to process…​ under the Debug menu item.","title":"Compiling on Windows","component":"opencpn-dev","version":"","name":"windows","url":"/opencpn-dev/windows.html","titles":[{"text":"5.8.0+ Fast Track","hash":"_5_8_0_fast_track","id":1},{"text":"Complete builds using Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition or Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition","hash":"_complete_builds_using_visual_studio_2022_community_edition_or_visual_studio_2019_community_edition","id":2}]},"69":{"id":69,"text":"The sources have a uniform coding formatting based on the Google Style.

It lets you download, install and keep up to date the navigational charts provided by various free governmental sources worldwide directly from within OpenCPN’s Toolbox. The Chart Downloader plugin is an Internal Plugin, always distributed with OpenCPN, no separate download is required. Source: Opencpn Internal Plugin Forum: Chart Downloader Forum The supported charts include both the raster and vector charts for the US waters provided by the NOAA, official raster navigational charts published by Argentina, Brasil and New Zealand (covering also huge areas of the Pacific ocean) as well as electronic charts of the inland waterways of the USA and more than a dozen European Union countries. You could use manual installation but Chart Downloader is preferred. The Chart Downloader relies on catalogs of charts. A catalog is an XML file containing the names of charts along with the most recent chart update date and time together with the Internet address of the actual chart data. Before being able to download any charts we have to configure and download one or more chart catalogs. The catalogs are provided by the agencies publishing the charts (NOAA and the Army Corps of Engineers in the USA) and by the ChartCatalogs project created by the author of this plugin. When a catalog is loaded the Chart Downloader automatically scans the existing charts on your computer looking for updated or new charts listed in the catalog. In the current version of OpenCPN, Chart Downloader is automatically included. This is what the plugin looks like when first opened by clicking Chart Downloader The screen has two sections. The top section is for Chart Catalogs. Some chart sources provide many different catalogs for the same set of charts. For example, in the USA, NOAA provides chart catalogs for each state, region and Coast Guard district as well as the huge complete set. There are also separate catalogs for raster (RNC) and vector (ENC) NOAA charts. The first step in getting new charts is to select the appropriate Chart Catalog, make sure you think first though - having everything is not always the best option to organize your charts, so especially in the US, consider using more smaller catalogs over the one with the complete set of thousands of charts. Click the button to get the dialog. There are catalogs for all the free chart sources worldwide known at the time of the release of this plugin. The catalogs are organized in a folder structure. Open each folder to see subfolders. Open subfolders to see catalogs. Select any catalog you like by clicking the catalog description. After clicking the catalog you want, the “Chart Directory” will be automatically filled in. This is the directory on your computer where the catalog and the charts for this catalog will be downloaded. If the recommended directory is acceptable click “OK”. First time users will find it much easier to accept this default. Otherwise you can use the “Browse” button to browse to another directory where you want the catalog and charts to be kept. Once you are happy with the Chart Directory click “OK”. In case you selected a path to save the charts not covered by the current OpenCPN configuration, the plugin configures it for you. You can check the configuration on the “Chart Files Tab”. For more details about managing your charts, you should definitely read Installing Charts. Now you will see the Chart Catalog listed in the Catalogs section. Note that it will say (Please update first) under the Released column. Click the catalog name then click the “Update” button. The Downloader will retrieve the catalog from the server. After the catalog is saved a list of charts will appear in the lower section. Each chart has a check box. If the box is checked then that chart is scheduled to be downloaded. Depending on the Preferences you selected earlier the boxes will be automatically checked. You can check or uncheck individual charts or use the right mouse button to check and uncheck groups of charts. The US agencies update their catalogs on a standard weekly schedule, related to the Notice to Mariners releases. The catalogs from the Chart Catalogs project are updated occasionally, without any fixed schedule. You should select the chart source and click the Update every once in a while to get the latest chart updates. You can select the charts to be downloaded by ticking the check boxes in the list of charts. In case you want to select multiple charts at once, right-click in Chart Window will show a context menu, allowing you to Select all Deselect all Invert selection Select updated Select newly released charts. You can configure the plugin to automatically preselect the updated and/or new charts after an update of the chart catalog in the preferences. In addition to the right-click chart selection, you can Highlight a chart, then use “Spacebar” to check or uncheck. Then hit the down or up button and repeat. This is faster than Mouse clicking for groups of files. After selecting the charts for download, click the “Download selected charts” button to start downloading the charts. It can be a lengthy progress and a dialog box showing progress will pop as each chart is downloaded. If any charts do not download correctly a warning will pop up at the end. The status of the charts that have been downloaded successfully will change to Up to Date. Sometimes a slow or flaky Internet connection will cause a chart not to download and the status will remain the same. You can just click the Download selected charts button again give them a second chance. A recent improvement is the use of a separate CPU thread (when it is available) for downloading charts. Chart Folder Tab and Chart Group Tab reminder. A reminder box will pop up to tell you that you have to notify OpenCPN where to find the charts. We’ll do that in the next step. Upon Closing the Chart Downloader will automatically complete a Scan and Database Rebuild of the Chart Database, so the charts will be ready for use. For vector charts, one sensible step remains. Go to Options→Charts→Chart Files and press the button Prepare all ENC Charts. This will preprocess all new vector charts and updates, and prevent delays when actually using the charts If you should see the dialog below please Update the internal chart database and the plugin will remind you about it with a dialog. For more details about managing your charts, you should definitely read Installing Charts. To make it short, go to Options > Chart Files Tab and tick the Scan Charts and Update Database checkbox and when you close the Toolbox using the OK, your newly downloaded charts will be scanned and made available for viewing. The button Show Local Files on the lower right will open your default file manager in a separate window, which allows you to check files and directories easily. You can customize the behavior of the plugin to certain extent. To access the preferences, select the Chart Downloader plugin on the Options > Plugins Tab and click on the Preferences button The Default Path to Charts option allows you to set the top directory for all your charts, used to construct the suggested locations for the chart sources you configure. The All updated charts and All new charts check boxes tell the plugin which charts you want to select for download automatically upon a catalog update. The Allow bulk update of all configured chart sources and charts checkbox adds a new button to the Chart Downloader Tab, allowing you to update and download all the charts you are managing using the plugin with a single click. The behavior of this function depends on the aforementioned check boxes - either it downloads only new or updated charts or both.","title":"Chart Downloader Tab","component":"chartdldr","version":"","name":"index","url":"/chartdldr/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Chart Downloader","hash":"_chart_downloader","id":1},{"text":"Links","hash":"_links","id":2},{"text":"A Few Basic Concepts","hash":"_a_few_basic_concepts","id":3},{"text":"Chart Catalogs","hash":"_chart_catalogs","id":4},{"text":"Chart Downloader Tab","hash":"_chart_downloader_tab","id":5},{"text":"Using the Chart Downloader","hash":"_using_the_chart_downloader","id":6},{"text":"Adding a chart source","hash":"_adding_a_chart_source","id":7},{"text":"Updating the catalogs","hash":"_updating_the_catalogs","id":8},{"text":"Selecting charts for download","hash":"_selecting_charts_for_download","id":9},{"text":"Downloading charts","hash":"_downloading_charts","id":10},{"text":"After the download","hash":"_after_the_download","id":11},{"text":"Checking the downloaded charts","hash":"_checking_the_downloaded_charts","id":12},{"text":"The Preferences","hash":"_the_preferences","id":13}]},"71":{"id":71,"text":"The Dashboard plugin is able to show quite a few instruments.

There are 2 parameters in the Dashboard→Preferences→Appearance dialog for damping of SOG and COG. A value of 1 means no filtering. Higher values mean ever slower response of the instrument. The max filter value is 100 which is pretty slow. This filter works almost exactly like a mechanical filter that uses an oil damped indicator dial. It will respond gradually to a change in course or speed. A typical filter value of 10 seems to work pretty well. Select these parameters as suits your use. These controls together enable the user to adjust the view of the dashboard to suit individual needs. Units Ranges and Formats Set the units to use, and the range of the speed dial. The Wind History Instrument needs some further explanations. The “wind history” instrument is meant to be run as a standalone (vertical) instrument. Just define a separate dashboard and add it as the only instrument. You can resize the Instrument with the mouse. In real conditions, it monitors around 40 min of wind direction (red), as well as wind speed (blue), showing a vertical time line every 5 min (the example screen shot is a full-speed VDR replay). The text on the top shows the current values, as it is displayed in the standard instruments (blue = wind speed data, TWS=True Wind Speed, red = direction, TWD = True Wind Direction). Here is an explanation of the text line, left side (see screen shot) TWS 7.5 true Wind Speed currently 7.5 kts Max 22.3 kts since 18::50 this is the max Wind speed in the visible graphs, i.e. the last ~40 mins Overall 22.3 the max wind speed since OpenCPN was started. Right side above TWD 357 degrees:: True wind direction currently 357 degrees The thin red/blue curves are the real direction/speed values, the thicker curves are smoothed values. Makes it easier to see trends. There is some logic included The instruments zooms automatically as much as possible, always trying to show the whole visible curve; Wind speed curve If your max (visible) wind speed is 10 kts, then your scale is from 0…11 kts (rounded upwards to the next full knot). In the screen shot we had a mx of 22.3kts –> scale is 0…23 kts. Wind direction The instrument scale shows/- 90 degrees of the currently visible data values, but is limited to a total of 360 degrees. If the wind is shifting through North (from 350, 355, 359, 002, 010, …) we’re shifting the curve as well, meaning that there is NO vertical jump in the data from 360 degrees –> 0 degrees, and we do NOT loose all the continuity in the smoothed curves ! If you should happen to have more than a full 360 degrees cycle of wind direction in the recorded data (if you sail through a couple of dust devils ), I limited the max scale to 360 degrees, meaning that the curve will run out of the visible area on bottom or on top of the instrument. Please note that you don’t have to have the instrument “open” all the time. Once activated as initially described, you can close it, and simply reopen it on demand. You don’t loose the curves, the instrument continues to collect the data. To make it visible again simply right click on an existing standard-dashboard, and click the “Wind History” Dashboard. In Windows, Night, F5, mode. The title bar on the floating dashboard window is a bit glaring (this mode is controlled by windows by way of a theme and is not possible to change from an application) . Dock the Dashboard into “docked mode” it will be less glaring. The best solution is to simply “dock” the dashboard window at night, either left or right. This brings the window decorations back under OCPN control, and we recently added logic to dim it in this mode. The dashboard plugin contains 3 instruments capable of displaying the time according to the preference of the user. GPS clock - Unmodified time provided by the GPS unit, if available. This value is UTC. Local GPS clock - Time from the GPS clock corrected by user defined timezone offset (see below) Local CPU clock - Local clock obtained from operating system On the appearance tab of the Dashboard preferences there is a setting for “Local offset from UTC”. The default is 00::00. When the 00::00 is selected th Local GPS clock will display time in the time zone of the computer running OpenCPN. If that is not what you want then you can selected any other offset in 30 minute increments up to/- 12 hours. The offset will be added to the GPS UTC time and the local computer time zone will be ignored. Sunrise/sunset are computed based on the date and lat/long from the GPS NMEA input data. They are not computed from the CPU clock or the ship’s position. So unless you have a GPS connected then the times of sunrise/sunset are probably not going to be right. It has always been thus. Nmea_Converter_pi can solve many compatibility or unit conversion issues. There are nine examples showing how the use NmeaConverter to adjust Dashboard output. Companion Plugin: Nmea_Converter_pi can solve many conversion problems.

The grib plugin is an Internal Plugin, always distributed with OpenCPN, no separate download is required. Source: Opencpn Internal Plugin Forum: Grib Weather Forum Grib_pi supports template numbers: 0, 10, 30 & 40 from this specification: https://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/docs/grib2/grib2_doc/grib2_table3-1.shtml If you are not familiar with grib weather files, make sure you understand the basics, before you start to use them. It is essential to understand the limitations of weather forecasts that are distributed in the grib format. It is also worth pointing out that gribs are not reliable near tropical systems. Send a blank mail to \"GribWarning(at symbol)saildocs.com\". Read the mail you get back carefully. To get started with gribs and to find sources for downloads, check Franks-Weather. A very good, up to date book, is “Modern Marine Weather, second edition” by David Burch, with a thorough treatment of the subject. OpenCPN can read both the original gribfile format, known as Grib1, as well as the new Grib2 format, with the .grb2 or .grib2 file-extension. OpenCPN Grib_pi has been updated to support all of the useful GFS parameters (Sept 2021). The WW3 model has been incorporated into the GFS, so we get waves now along with the wind and pressure (and reflectivity)… plus the waves go out 16 days and not just the 8 of WW3, and the resolution is now 0.25º and when it was 0.5 before. To learn more about the various grib formats and models available, see: Grib School by Davd Burch Luckgrib NBM announcement Luckgrib probability for the results To display grib files as an overlay on your normal charts you have to first activate the grib icon Go to Find the plugin tab. Click on the Grib plugin, then the “Enable” button. The “Preferences” Button brings up a small dialog. The settings in this dialog rarely needs changing after the initial setup. Use High Definition Graphics. The setting only concerns the barbed wind arrows.Tick the “Use High Definition Graphics” box, unless you are on old hardware. Not ticking the “High Definition Graphics” box can help to speed up the grib display on a slow computer. Use Gradual Colors. This setting applies to all colored overlay maps. On many installations the difference in rendering is very small. The overlay maps built in color variation plays a part. Copy First Cumulative Missing Record. This is about rainfall and cloud cover records. As these records are “cumulative” the first one does not exist in files from zyGrib and Saildocs. With this parameter unchecked, there will be neither rainfall and nor cloud cover displayed for the first date/time of the file. Ticking the box fixes the problem. Copy Missing Wave Records. This only concerns wave records from zyGrib delivers files from two models ; FNMOC (WW3-…) for waves and GFS for all other parameters. These two forecast models does not have the same time spacing. For some dates/times, the wave data do not exist.This parameter allows this missing data to be reconstructed and avoiding the overlay (if set) to flicker. Load the More Recent File in Directory. Loads the newest file in the grib directory on start. Load the Last Open File. Loads the grib file used last time. Important Start at the first forecast in GRIB file Start at the nearest forecast to current time Authorize interpolation to start at current time. Local Time UTC To start the Grib plugin press the The “GRIB Display Control” then pops up. Hide Data at Cursor This is a smart and compact dialog. For a quick start press the “Open File” button and navigate to your grib file directory and press the file to be displayed. Previous/Next Go to the previous or the next record in the gribfile. This corresponds to the time “interval” chosen when the grib file was downloaded. Data valid at The time of validity for all grib data on screen. Open Grib file The name of the grib file in use. Now Displays the record, nearest in time to “now” according to the Start option you have selected: (“Start at the nearest forecast to current time” or “Authorize interpolation to start at current time”). Select Geopotential Height If grib data for geopotential height is available, selection will be between Std, 500. Zoom to Center This button will home in on the loaded area that the loaded grib file covers. Play Goes through all records in turn, with the animation speed controlled in the “Grib Settings” dialog. Hide Cursor Data Hides Grib which normally appears in the data windows. Data windows are hidden. Progress Slider Just to the right of the “Play” button is a slider that is just another way of going through the grip records. Open File Activates the operating systems standard file selector dialog to select a grib file. The plugin remembers the directory of this grib. This is used next time you start OpenCPN and activates the Grib plugin. See settings in the “Grib Preferences” dialog above. Settings is where to control how the different grib data will be displayed. See more below. Request Download grib files via email. More below. GRIB Data at Cursor. This is where the “smart” part kicks in. Only entries for the data contained in the active grib file will be displayed. For example, if there is no wave data in the current grib file, there will be no signs of wave data at all. In the case above, where the the wave data is N/A, the grib file includes wave data, but not for the area where the cursor is. Compare with the picture below, where the grib only contains current data. The tick boxes next to each data entry, are used to activate the data-display on the screen. Exactly what will be shown is controlled in the “Grib Settings” dialog, which is reached by pressing the “Settings” button. Don’t activate to many display features at the same time. The display quickly becomes very cluttered. The “GRIB Display Control” loaded with a grib file only containing current data. Advanced GRIB Data at Cursor. The display options for all the data shown, can be reached by right.clicking on the little squares where the “ticks” are shown. For the meaning of all these options, read on. Right-clicking the “Air Temp” option square. The plugin has an advanced mode were altitude data can be displayed. This mode requires some more knowledge than plain gribs. A good start is to read https://vos.noaa.gov:443/MWL/dec_08/milibar_chart.shtml [Mariner’s Guide to the 500—​Millibar Chart] If a grib file includes altitude data, the control will automatically include more options. See below. If the dialog looks normal except for an extra selection box under “GRIB Data at Cursor”, like this, Then the grib file contains altitude data. Selecting one of the altitudes, for example 500, changes the dialog to what you see above. The advanced data are displayed against a yellow background. Wind. These are the wind data valid for the selected altitude level. Grib Data at 500 hPa. The values at the selected level. Right click on Pressure and select what you want. Once a grib file is loaded in the current session, the “Weather table” appears in the right click menu. Click the entry, and a Weather Table, valid at the cursor point, pops up. All available data in the current grib file, for the whole time span, are shown. NOTE: To change the Wind & Wave Arrows to Degrees, just hit the Dir switch. …controls how the grib files are displayed on the screen, and units used in the Grib Display control. Things like overlay colors, animation time interval and speed and much more. The basic dialog looks like this. Typical DATA TAB Note the Fixed or Minimum Spacing (pixels) selection. This is a typical setting. Typical GUI TAB Typical PLAYBACK TAB The Loop Mode controls what happens when “Play” is pressed in the Grib Display Control. Loop Mode. Sets the “Play” function into a loop mode. Otherwise, playback will stop when reaching the end of the file. Loop Start. Were to start the loop. The option “Current time forecast” makes sure that only data now or in the future are shown Updates per Second. Controls the speed of “play”. Loop Start. The loop can start either at the start of the grib file or from the current time forecast. Interpolate between gribs. If you select this option, you will be able to choose your own time interval, but you have to consider that it can decrease data accuracy. To remind you, this info will pop up. Time Interval. This is the time interval used for interpolation. The entry is only visible if “Interpolate between gribs” is ticked. This is connected tho the chosen time interval when requesting a grib file. The lower part of the Grib Settings Dialog, under the Display heading is really 10 different controls. The controls are activated by the choosing one of the items in the selection menu below. Many of the entries are repeated, so lets first have a closer look at the the most important one, the Wind. Entries on the same line are connected. Units refers to the choice of units for the selected record. For wind speed the choices are. Barbed Arrows Display the traditional barbed arrows, showing wind direction and wind speed. Range refers to the distance between displayed arrows (not working 3.3.1117). Default Color/Controlled Colors Default is dark brown while “Controlled” varies from blue for very light winds to red for very strong winds. Always visible This option only exists for “Wind” and “Pressure”. When ticked the object is shown regardless of what is ticked in the “Settings Control”. The idea is to be able to Show wind and/or pressure at the same time as other options. Use with Rainfall, for example, to help identifying fronts. Display Isotachs shows contour lines connecting points with the same wind speed. Spacing controls which wind speed Isotachs will be shown. Use knots for units and 10 for spacing and isotach contours will be shown at 10 kts, 20kts and so on. OverlayMap Depending on your system capability,if you use “Accelerated Graphics (OpenGL)” (see General Options/Display/Advanced), the overlay will be visible at all scales. But if you don’t, the overlay will only be visible at small scales. A small yellow pop up at the bottom left of the screen will inform you. Zoom out to a scale of 1:13 millions, or smaller to see them. Colors is another selection menu containing pre-set color schemes. The idea is to use the scheme with the same name as the control, but this is just a hint, nothing more. Numbers shows the wind speed in small square boxes. Minimum Spacing refers to the spacing between these boxes. Particle Map is a kind of animation of the wind field. It is created by letting “particles”, or dots, move in the wind direction and leave a trail. The trail is colored after the wind strength, and each particle has a limited “life span”. The Density slider creates particle trails that are shorter but closer together with increased value, which is the same as further to the right. The particle Map below clearly shows a convergence zone with stronger winds (red). This is probably a cold front. Performance Warning: Note that high density Particle Maps on Low Powered Machines and Large Files may slow your machine to a crawl. First test on small files. Overlay Transparency works as expected. All the controls for Wind Gust, Rainfall and Cloud Cover, have similar entries; only the units differ. The pressure display has no overlays, only the options of isobars and numbers. Overlay Transparency is redundant. Waves and Current have a more or less similar display. A Particle Map is available for currents. See the descripion above for wind Particle Maps. Once again different units. There is a choice between three different display arrows shown in two sizes. If wave height, direction and wave period is present in the grib file it will be displayed in the Display Control like this: Air Temperature and Sea Temperature looks the same. Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) has these settings Altitude and Relative Humidity have a simple one choice entry. Grib files can be requested directly from the plugin. The request is in the form of an email to SailDocs or ZyGrib. The requested grib file is also delivered via email as an attachment. The area for which data is requested defaults to the area visible on the screen, but the request area can be selected by other means as well. See more below. It’s possible to request gribs from 4 different Grib prediction models when using Saildocs GFS, COAMPS, RTOFS and indirectly WW3. When you request “Waves” in GFS, Saildocs merge wavedata from WW3 into the delivered grib. The ZyGrib option can only deliver GFS gribs, which is the “standard” model for gribs. RTOFS gribs only contains current and water temperature data. COAMPS delivers wind and pressure with a higher resolution than GFS The minimum times between grib records are 3h for GFS and 6h for COAMPS & RTOFS. GFS can be requested for 8 days ahead. An extended GFS request up to 16 days ahead is possible. This warning will pop up. The same value for COAMPS is 3 days and RTOFS 6 days. There are two layouts of this dialog, depending on whether it is a request to SaiDocs or to ZyGrib. Some alternatives are only available from SailDocs, and some are only available from zyGrib. Alternatives not available are grayed out. Compose the request by picking parameters and data. Not all data are available for all choices of parameters. For example, in the picture above “Wind Gusts” and “Current” are grayed out, as the are not available with GFS from SailDocs. When selecting “Moving Grib” the dialog expands and makes it possible to choose a speed and course. The selected grib forecast area will move, using these values, for each grib interval. The idea behind this is to minimize the download while still covering a longer passage. Moving grib files are incompatible with interpolation, so if a “moving file” is detected a warning is displayed. Interpolation, if set is deactivated, but only for moving file, the settings as such, are not modified. Resolution The choices are 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0. A recent upgrade to gribs makes it possible to download even 0.25° resolution. This is not yet an alternative in the plugin and requires editing the email manually before sending. In the picture above …|0.5,0.5|… should instead look like …|0.25,0.25|… The default geographical coverage of the requested grib file is the area you can see on the screen. A manual Selection Mode is also available. When the Area Selection → Manual Selection box is ticked the dialog expands Choose the limiting Latitude and Longitude for the grib-file manually or press “Start graphic Sel.” button. Press the left mouse-button and draw a rectangle around the required area. When selecting “Pressure Altitude” and the GFS forecast model, the dialog expands and makes it possible to choose forecasts for different altitude levels. The SailDocs dialog only supports the 500 mb altitude, while zyGrib suports all options. When you are ready press “Send”. This message will show in the “Mail” window instead of the “send” request: Your request is ready. An email is prepared in your email environment. You have just to verify and send it... Save or Cancel to finish...or Continue... As stated, a mail is composed for you and ready to send with your normal mailing program.

The pick Open and the two grib files will be opened. Both grib files will be used by Weather_routing. In grib_pi settings I always use the “Current” “Proportional Arrow” Refer to the weather routing plugin for the use of two Grib Files (Wind Current)] There are many aspects to the use of grib files which lead to the use of other companion programs or plugins. ZyGrib is a free and open-source software (FOSS) dedicated grib viewer. Grib files can be downloaded by ZyGrib and then opened in OpenCPN. Opengrib Other sources of gribs, also a grib server. Download Mediterranean Grib Files Weather-Routing tools use Grib_pi and Grib data to create optimized routing based on boat performance files. OpenCPN has an excellent weather_routing plugin which works in concert with grib_pi and climatology_pi concurrently, so that grib files are extended by Climatology’s monthly averages for planning long voyages. * https://www.meltemus.com/index.php/en/, is another FOSS weather routing program, combines a grib file with boat polar data, and produces an optimized route. These are very good tools to use in routing decisions, but they all have the same limitations as all grib-data. (These notes are from the SailDocs Grib Server) This grib file is extracted from a computer forecast model. While such computer data can provide useful guidance for general wind flow, there are limitations which must be understood. What you are receiving is a weather prediction generated by a computer run by NOAA/NCEP (GFS, WW3 models) or the US Navy (comaps, nogaps) and downloaded and processed by Saildocs (a service of Sailmail). The network is complex, and any computer network is subject to hardware and software failures or human error which can effect accuracy or availability of data. In particular, if our servers were not able to download a current data file then the grib-file may be based on old data. The file information is shown above and also contained in the file itself. Also remember that grib data is not reviewed by forecasters before being made available. You are getting a small part of the raw model data that the forecasters themselves use when writing a forecast, and it is your responsibility to make sure that the data is consistent with your local conditions and with the professionally-generated forecasts (e.g. text bulletins and weather-fax charts). Grib data also has limitations along shore, where local effects often dominate and may not be adequately modeled. In addition these models cannot provide adequate prediction for tropical systems, frontal activity or convergence zones. For example, while global models can provide useful data on the likely track of hurricanes, they grossly underestimate the strength of hurricanes because of their small size compared to the model grid. For hurricane/cyclone forecasts, carefully monitor the appropriate warning messages and do not rely on grib data from any source. Grib data can provide useful guidance not available elsewhere. Understand the limitations and use the data carefully. Grib data should be considered supplemental to other forecasts, and not be relied upon in lieu of professionally-generated charts or forecasts.

How to install and configure sSMTP: 1) Install the ssmtp package. If another MTA is already installed, you may be asked to uninstall it before installing ssmtp. Once it’s done you can test it by typing this command: “whereis sendmail” The answer should be something like “/usr/sbin/sendmail”. Use that answer in the next command: “ls -la /usr/sbin/sendmail” If everything is OK you should get this answer: “/usr/sbin/sendmail → ssmtp” showing that Sendmail function is now connected to ssmtp. 2) Now there are two files to set: the first file : /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf ( with root rights ) The typical setting should be: root=postmaster AuthUser=yourlogin to your ISP access AuthPass=yourpasseword to your ISP access mailhub=yourISPserveurname.yourdomain (for example smtp.orange.fr) rewriteDomain=yourdomain FromLineOverride=YES hostname= the full host-name ( normally automatically entered, but if not you can type the command : “hostname” to get it) For ISP requiring a TLS connection , it could be necessary to add the line UseTLS=YES or UseSTARTTLS=YES the second file : /etc/ssmtp/revaliases (with root rights) Enter this line. root:yourlogin@yourdomain:yourISPserveurname.yourdomain the default port was 25 but now many ISP refuse it and use 587.

Very interesting article, showing a good use for lidar. This shows why the World Magnetic Model plugin (WMM_pi) needs to be updated on a regular basis.. Source: Opencpn Internal Plugin Forum: WorldMagnetic Model Plugin (WMM) Thread Forum: WMMThread This plugin is all about the value of the magnetic variation. The value at your boat position, at the position of the cursor, and the rest of the world. Download and install the plugin. Go to Options–>Plugins. Press the “Enable” button. Then press the Preference button, and copy the settings below. Press OK twice. The WMM icon will now be found in your ToolBar. The numbers in the button is the variation at your position. Press the Toolbar Button and the small dialog below will appear on the screen. The first value is the same as in the button, the variation at your boat (gps) position. The second value is the variation at the position of the cursor. That is all you need to know to get started, and for most of your daily use. Need more details? Read on! World Magnetic Model Plotting allows users to cross reference the magnetic deviation values printed on many raster charts. Variation is the angle between true and magnetic north. Inclination is the vertical angle of the magnetic field. A compass is adjusted for the inclination in the intended sales region. If you buy a compass in Europe; it will not be level in Australia, for example. Field Strength is the magnetic field in nano tesla from 20000 to 66000. Currently the total field strength is shown, with no immediate practical use. Hopefully this will change to show the horizontal component in the future, that has an impact on whether the compass works or not, near the magnetical poles. The plotted lines are similar to a topographic map. The space between them can be adjusted; more space takes less time to calculate. The Step size and Pole accuracy sliders allow a trade off for speed vs computation time. With the extended Radio-button, this dialog will show on the screen F - Total Intensity of the geomagnetic field H - Horizontal Intensity of the geomagnetic field X - North Component of the geomagnetic field Y - East Component of the geomagnetic field Z - Vertical Component of the geomagnetic field I (DIP) - Geomagnetic Inclination D (DEC) - Geomagnetic Declination (Magnetic Variation) Click “Settings” and adjust the display of the graphical plot.

This is so that the plugin can find it’s own data directory even if relocated to a new location. Ensure that LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not overwritten by plugin if it’s already set (for plugins which uses it, most don’t) Use the new find_in_path() function to locate binary helpers as a fallback if hardcoded paths does not work (for plugins which uses helpers, most don’t). Ensure that plugin does not link to libraries outside the git tree, in particular the msvc opencpn.lib import library. Ensure that plugin is installed in sane paths, in particular on Mac. And some new code: Build a .tar.gz bundle together with the tradtional installer. Add support for building a plugin metadata XML file. Give the package a more unique name. This is a requirement from deployment sites like bintray where all plugins share a common namespace. Add continous integration support (if not already in place). Add support for building a flatpak plugin. This list is supposed to be exhaustive — many plugins are simple enough.

[ShipDriver_pi](https://github.com/Rasbats/shipdriver_pi/) is simpler example, but still complex enough to cover most plugin cases. Testing a new or modified plugin The item to test is a tarball. The easiest way to test it is to use the new \"Import plugin\" function which allows using a plugin directly without downloading it from an url. More complete testing requires the plugin to be available in a catalog. See the plugins project at https://github.com/opencpn/plugins Source code formatting The preferred style for cmake files is the modern one with lower_case commands, two spaces indentation and plain endif (), something like if (MSVC) set(_msvc_flag \"some value\") endif () This is supported by the cmake-format utility, https://github.com/cheshirekow/cmake_format.

Here, a number of plugins are available for users so they can just click on a plugin to install it. The managed plugins workflow is the way a plugin becomes available for users in this UI dialog. In general, plugin code flows like this: Source code is stored and eventually tagged and released on Github As soon as a change is committed a number of builder services build the code for around 10 platforms. The compiled plugins are stored on cloudsmith. Here, they get a url which can be used to download them. The builds also produce metadata files with plugin data such as name, platform, various info and the download URL. The metadata files are used to create a catalog. This catalog is the underpinning for the list of plugins in the OpenCPN plugin dialog. Alec Leamas is the main architect of the managed plugin system for OpenCPN. His guide is here. The OpenCPN Developers Manual has extensive general documentation for managed plugins. It also describes the two alternative template systems testplugin and shipdriver. This document provides more info on the shipdriver setup and workflow. A managed plugin will nearly always start as a `legacy' plugin that installs locally on the developers machine. Alec has provided new scripts to build a managed version of the plugin for OpenCPN. The legacy plugin is the starting point and the purpose of this guide is to describe the steps involved. The aim is to simplify the workflow. The reference plugin where the development work has been carried out is ShipDriver (Master branch).

This document tries to describe the procedures. When the dependencies are installed the build is done as described in INSTALL.md which distributed in every plugin. A (possibly outdated) copy is available in the Usage page. Before build, run the buildwin\\win_deps.bat file. The file requires a working choco installation, see https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/setup The first run will install various software using choco, and should be invoked with administrative privileges. Subsequent builds should still invoke the file, but it can be done with regular permissions. A batch file has been found useful for modifying source code with Visual Studio 2017. If not already done, first clone the git sources. Then, in the plugin directory, install build dependencies using something like $ sudo apt install devscripts equivs $ sudo mk-build-deps -ir build-deps/control $ sudo apt-get -q --allow-unauthenticated install -f Building Flatpak requires a Linux host. The first step is to install flatpak as described in https://flatpak.org/setup/ Proceed by installing flatpak-builder. Most distributions including Ubuntu and Fedora have this packaged, making it possible to install using tools like apt(8) or dnf(8). Then install the build dependencies using something like $ flatpak remote-add --user --if-not-exists \\ flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo $ flatpak install --user flathub org.freedesktop.Platform//22.08 $ flatpak install --user flathub org.freedesktop.Sdk//22.08 $ flatpak install --user flathub org.opencpn.OpenCPN 22.08 is the runtime version which indeed is 22.08 at the time of writing. Review the flatpak/org.opencpn.*yaml file to check this, look for runtime-version. The templates supports creating tarballs for 32-bit armhf and 64-bit arm64 targets. Building these requires a local installation of the Android Native Development Kid (NDK) which can be found at https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads. The build needs to locate the installed NDK. By default, it uses the path /opt/android/ndk. This can be utilized by creating a symlink, something like sudo ln -s /opt/android/android-ndk-* /opt/android/ndk. As an alternative, the NDK_HOME environment variable can be used. It should contain the complete path to the NDK directory. Android builds also needs an updated cmake version. In general, the NDK and cmake needs to be synchronized — an old cmake version is not likely to work with an updated NDK. This is an issue on some platforms, notably all Debian-based which includes Ubuntu. The work-around is to use python to install the python wheel distributed by Kitware using somehting like pip install --user cmake. This requires a working, updated python3 installation. Use the ci script, which just installs the build deps and configures when used in a non-CI environment: $ ci/circleci-build-macos After the initial run the build dependencies are in place and configured.

Instructions for modifying and installation is included in the sample. Note that all other tools depends on this file. The script scripts/local-build supports building various platforms. With complete build dependencies in place it can build native Linux, cross-compiled Android and emulated Raspbian/armhf targets on a Linux host. At the time of writing this is 9 builds. On windows, the script builds a single Windows target. Use python scripts/local-build help to get started. The supported targets are listed. On Linux, all available targets can be built using scripts/local-build gui. All builds includes uploading to cloudsmith, pushing metadata and tarballs available for testing. Local builds creates different build directories like build-xenial, build-flatpak etc. in order to avoid collisions between different builds. When completed, the local build creates a build directory which contains a *.tar.gz tarball and an *.xml metadata file. The tarball can be tested using the Import Plugin function available in the OpenCPN Settings | Plugins page. After a local, \"manual\" build the results can be uploaded to Cloudsmith using the scripts/local-upload script. The scripts needs the configuration from the configuration file.

This page describes this process. The reference plugin where the development work has been carried out is ShipDriver (Master branch). To show the process from start TideFinder is used as an illustration. Before using the shipdriver templates a plugin must as a first step be adapted to the Plugin Installer as described in the Developer Manual Page. The script update-templates script has been written to simplify the process of adding the directories/files needed for the workflow. You will need git bash for running the script. A guide is included in UPDATE_TEMPLATES.md. The script will install all files required in TideFinder except as noted below. Note that script is normally used to update to from a tag like sd3.0.0 All plugins should have README.md which gives a short summary of the plugin, links to documentation and, important, an overall copyright and license statement. This is a legal requirement to be able to distribute the plugin Files in the templates have different licenses, all compatible with GPL version 3 or later (GPLv3+). If you choose to use this license, there should also be a file COPYING containing the license. This could be retrieved using git checkout shipdriver/master COPYING The templates have divided the usual, single CMakeLists.txt into two files Plugin.cmake and CMakeLists.txt. Plugin.cmake contains everything which is specific for the plugin. CMakeLists.txt is part of the templates and the same in all plugins. After running the script, Plugin.cmake is still missing. It can be added using git checkout sd3.0.0 Plugin.cmake, assuming update-templates was updating to sd3.0.0 This file needs to be modified, most of the required items will be available in CMakeLists.txt. After having modified Plugin.cmake to match TideFinder checkout the generic, template CMakeLists.txt using git checkout sd3.0.0 CMakeLists.txt, assuming update-templates used the sd3.0.0 tag. This will overwrite the existing CMakeLists.txt, but after all it is in the git history. Commit the two files. Start by checking out the shipdriver flatpak directory using: git checkout shipdriver/master flatpak The directory will contain a file named org.opencpn.OpenCPN.Plugin.shipdriver.yaml. This should be renamed to match the TideFinder plugin i. e., org.opencpn.OpenCPN.Plugin.TideFinder.yaml. After renaming it, edit file and replace ShipDriver with TideFinder in all places. This is enough for simple plugins. If org.opencpn.OpenCPN.Plugin.TideFinder.yaml already exists and flatpak builds fail compare the file with org.opencpn.OpenCPN.Plugin.shipdriver.yaml in the ShipDriver repo. A small edit for the flatpak SDK version may be needed. Remove src/ocpn_plugin.h from the source files listed in Plugin.cmake. This is now found in the libs/api-16 directory. The file should also be removed from the src directory.

Windows works the same way when using git-bash, except that the chmod command does not make sense here and hence is omitted. To just copy update-templates from a local shipdriver clone has caused problems for some users. The only supported workflow is the one described here. As in linux, bootstrapping is only required if the script is not yet available in the plugin repo. Once installed, it’s self-updating. The script is written in bash, so git-bash is required. Using git-bash, the script can be downloaded and installed as in linux, see above. Using the Windows command CLI goes like: > cd some_plugin > set repo=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rasbats/shipdriver_pi/master > curl %repo%/update-templates --output update-templates > git add update-templates > git commit -m \"Add update-templates script\" The script is run from the plugin top directory using ./update-templates.

Script unconditionally updates known files and commits them directly. Examples: update-templates shipdriver/v3.0 -- get updates from v3.0 branch update-templates sd3.0.0 -- get updates from sd3.0.0 tag update-templates -l -- list all available tags The default alternative is (should be) to update to the latest available tag. The default option using shipdriver/master is basically for template development. As part of the 3.0.0 transition CMakeLists.txt is split into one plugin-specific file Plugin.cmake and a generic CMakeLists.txt. Later updates are only supposed to affect CMakeLists.txt while Plugin.cmake, the plugin-specific parts is kept as-is. The \"flatpak manifest\" is the yaml file configuring the flatpak build, named like flatpak/org.opencpn.OpenCPN.Plugin.\\*.yaml. This might need to be updated. If there have been changes to the shipdriver manifest since the last release these are added as comments at the end of the manifest. Review the file, consider applying corresponding changes to the manifest and eventually remove the comment.

This means that a plugin which depends on an external library not available by just installing OpenCPN must handle this in various other ways like: Rebuild from source. This is the only option in the flatpak case. OTOH, the flatpak runtime is quite large and contains a lot of common libraries. Link statically. Preliminary findings are that this works on MacOS but not in Debian; Debian static libs seems to be compiled without -fPIC which means that they cannot be linked into a shared library. YMMV. Bundle the dynamic library. By default. linux has an RPATH which points to both the plugin directory and it’s parent. This means that a library .so file bundled in any of these locations will be used by the plugin. The [photolayer_pi](https://github.com/Rasbats/photolayer_pi) plugin contains examples on all these strategies. The proj and libgeotiff libs are rebuilt from sources. The libtiff library is bundled on Debian and linked statically on MacOS. The \"rebuild from source\" is done in libs/geotiff and the flatpak yaml manifest. To check the dependencies of a plugin there are the otool -L (MacOS), ldd (Linux) and dumpbin (Windows) tools which lists the runtime dependencies of a plugin. By default, these are run on all plugin builds besides flatpak. The MacOS and Windows output is relatively easy to read while the Linux ldd output probably is too messy for regular checks. It might be useful when debugging though.

A possible git tag attached to the commit which overrides all other versioning The Cloudsmith push logic, which selects the repository to use based on the git tag, if any. These parts could be used in different workflows. The version syntax is basically major.minor.patch[.tweak][-prerelease]+[buildinfo_]target An example: 3.0.1+456.0a59905_flatpak-aarch64-20.08 3.0.1 represents major.minor.patch. The 'tweak' part is not set, it is then 0 and not visible. A prerelease part like -beta1 is not set. buildinfo is '456.0a59905', a build number and the git hash (below) target is 'flatpak-aarch64-20.08'. The last part is a version number, the rest a valid target. The list of valid targets is available in '' in the file ocpn-plugin.xsd. The base version is setup in Plugin.cmake. It consists of PKG_VERSION and PKG_PRERELEASE. PKG_VERSION could be set to a value like '3.0.1' or '3.0.1.4' which will go into the base version (above). PKG_PRERELEASE could be set to a value like 'beta1' which then will make up for a base version like '3.0.1-beta1'. Without a tag (below) the templates adds a buildinfo part like '456.0a59905_flatpak-20.08-aarch64' which contains a build number, the git commit hash and a target platform. This ensures that different builds always have unique build info which also is sortable. When a build number is not available, for example in local builds, a timestamp is used instead. On a sidenote the templates adds more complete build info, usually a link to the ci build, as a comment in the XML metadata. If a git tag pointing to the commit being built exists, the tag is used as version. This means that the tag completely overrides both the base version defined in Plugin.cmake and the automatic build info. That is, if the git tag is 1.0.3-alpha1 the version in 1.0.3-alpha1, whatever the contents of Plugin.cmake. The templates configures three different Cloudsmith repositories. The naming schemes differs somewhat: Commits without a git tag are pushed to the unstable/Alpha repository. Commits with a git tag matching 'beta' or 'rc' is pushed to the Beta repository. Commits with any other tag is pushed to the stable/Prod repository. How these are configured to actual repositories is described in the Builder Environment Page All sorts of versioning schemes are possible using the tools described above. The simplest way (personal view): Assume we have just released 1.3.2 The new cycle aiming for the 1.3.3 release is started by updating PKG_VERSION to 1.3.3 New commits are added. When there is a need to test, the system generates automatic versions which are perfectly usable, there is no need to touch PKG_VERSION. The automatic version works both in local and in CI builds. CI builds will pushed to the Cloudsmith Alpha/unstable repository. When it’s time for the first beta, the commit is tagged with a tag '1.3.3-beta1'. The version then becomes '1.3.3-beta1'. A CI build will be pushed the the cloudsmith beta repository, and the build can be published. The final release is tagged with '1.3.3'. This then becomes the stable version. The CI build will be uploaded to the stable/Prod repository. Rinse and repeat. Other workflows are based on updating PKG_VERSION for each build. The primary drawback is that this means that the version needs to be defined both in Plugin.cmake and the git tag — only the git tag creates a \"clean\" version without buildinfo.","title":"Versioning","component":"AlternativeWorkflow","version":"","name":"Versioning","url":"/AlternativeWorkflow/Versioning.html","titles":[{"text":"General","hash":"_general","id":1},{"text":"The Syntax","hash":"_the_syntax","id":2},{"text":"The Base Version","hash":"_the_base_version","id":3},{"text":"Automatic Build Info","hash":"_automatic_build_info","id":4},{"text":"Git Tags","hash":"_git_tags","id":5},{"text":"Cloudsmith Uploads","hash":"_cloudsmith_uploads","id":6},{"text":"Proposed Workflow.","hash":"_proposed_workflow","id":7}]},"99":{"id":99,"text":"The shipdriver template is a buildsystem template which can be applied to any OpenCPN plugin.

A managed plugin becomes available for an OpenCPN user in the Plugins options dialog. Here, a number of plugins are available for users so they can just click on a plugin to install it. The managed plugins workflow is the way a plugin becomes available for users in this UI dialog. In general, plugin code flows like this: Source code is stored and eventually tagged and released on Github As soon as a change is committed a number of builder services build the code for around 10 platforms. The compiled plugins are stored on cloudsmith. Here, they get a url which can be used to download them. The builds also produce metadata files with plugin data such as name, platform, various info and the download URL. The metadata files are used to create a catalog. This catalog is the underpinning for the list of plugins in the OpenCPN plugin dialog. The template installation process is described in the Adaptation Overview Page. Alec Leamas is the main architect of the managed plugin system for OpenCPN. The reference documentation is available here. The OpenCPN Developers Manual has extensive general documentation for managed plugins. It also describes the two alternative template systems testplugin and shipdriver. This document provides more info on the shipdriver setup and workflow. A managed plugin will often start as a `legacy' plugin that installs locally on the developers machine. Alec has provided new scripts to build a managed version of the plugin for OpenCPN. The legacy plugin is the starting point and the purpose of this guide is to describe the steps involved. The aim is to simplify the workflow. This workflow is not limited to legacy plugins, it can basically be applied to any plugin. Mike Rossiter, who developed the ShipDriver and TideFinder plugins, assisted by testing the workflow. He has produced this guide to assist developers in making a managed plugin.

Metadata push requires user to have forked the github repository at https://github.com/opencpn/plugins.

This page describes how to run the script new-credentials. GIT_KEY_PASSWORD should be the password entered to this script. A plugin build usually uploads to cloudsmith repositories. The repositories used depends on the git tag attached to the build, if any. The repositories used by default are hardcoded in Plugin.cmake in snippets like set(OCPN_TEST_REPO \"opencpn/shipdriver-alpha\" CACHE STRING \"Default repository for untagged builds\" ) set(OCPN_BETA_REPO \"opencpn/shipdriver-beta\" CACHE STRING \"Default repository for tagged builds matching 'beta'\" ) set(OCPN_RELEASE_REPO \"opencpn/shipdriver-prod\" CACHE STRING \"Default repository for tagged builds not matching 'beta'\" ) When forking a plugin, the developer hasn’t permissions to upload to these hardcoded repositories which belongs to the original owner. To fix this, other repos could be defined using the environment variables CLOUDSMITH_UNSTABLE_REPO, CLOUDSMITH_BETA_REPO and CLOUDSMITH_STABLE_REPO.

The goal is to simplify the process for creating pull requests against OpenCPN/plugins. When enabled, all metadata files created when the plugin is built are replicated to a fork of OpenCPN/plugins set up by the user. This fork can be used to make a PR against OpenCPN/plugins. In particular, there is no need to download metadata files from Cloudsmith in order to make a PR. The configuration is documented in the plugins fork configuration page When the builders are run, the git-push part will Make a clone of the OpenCPN/plugins fork repository Add the new metadata file. Commit and push the change to the auto branch in the OpenCPN/plugins fork As mentioned, the changes are pushed to the 'auto' branch by default. The branch name can be tweaked using the GIT_BRANCH environment variable in the builder. If GIT_KEY_PASSWORD or GIT_REPO is missing git-push will not do anything besides some logging. The builders have made commits in the OpenCPN/plugins fork’s auto branch, one for each build. These commits are the metadata files which work with the plugin installer of the main OpenCPN program. In beta and production mode they become part of the beta and master catalogs of plugins in OpenCPN. The files in the auto branch needs to be merged into either master, Beta or Alpha branch. When done, the branch could be used to make a PR against the plugins project. The workflow is somehat different if working with master or Beta branch. Using Alpha is basically the same as Beta, substituting Beta with Alpha. First: sync the local master branch with upstream using this guide or on the command line: $ git remote update upstream $ git checkout master $ git rebase upstream/master Add the files in the auto branch to master using: $ git fetch origin auto:auto $ git checkout auto $ git rebase master $ git checkout master $ git merge --squash auto $ git commit -m \"Merging auto branch into master\" The rebase operation should not be strictly necessary, but will pick up possible errors if the metadata has been changed by other means. The --squash option lumps the too many commits in the auto branch (one for each build) to a single one, keeping the master branch tidy. A PR (pull request) can then be made from the master branch for updating the master catalog of OpenCPN/plugins. First: sync the local Beta branch with upstream using this guide or on the command line: $ git remote update upstream $ git checkout --track origin/Beta $ git rebase upstream/Beta Add the files in the auto branch to Beta using: $ git fetch origin auto:auto $ git checkout auto $ git rebase Beta $ git checkout Beta $ git merge --squash auto $ git commit -m \"Merging auto branch into Beta\" Some metadata for older versions is \"frozen\". This means that these versions are kept as-is without changes when new versions are built. However, for other versions normally only the last version should be used. The command $ ls -lt metadata/my-plugin* lists all metadata files for given plugin in date order. Use git rm to remove all older files besides those which are frozen. When completed, commit using for example: $ git commit -m \"Removing obsoleted metadata.\" Create a catalog and check it against the xsd specification: $ tools/ocpn-metadata generate --userdir metadata/ \\ --destfile ocpn-plugins.xml --force $ xmllint --noout ocpn-plugins.xml This xmllint check is not strictly necessary, it’s done automatically on every PR when pushed. However, it shortcuts handling of problems. When testing is complete or just not deemed necessary: push using git push origin master or git push origin Beta. The ci/git-push script can be run manually for debugging purposes as described in the Local CI build page If metadata from builds does not show up in the auto branch: First check the build logs: does the git-push step complete? Last part of a successful git-push message should contain something like To github.com:leamas/plugins.git 6beead5..8c0a9a9 auto -> auto which means that auto branch is updated to 8c0a9a9 . Remember that commit In the OpenCPN/plugins clone check that commit: $ git fetch origin $ git show 8c0a9a9 This will display the actual changes to the metadata file. Are they sound? Checkout the auto branch (git checkout auto) and check the metadata file using some editor. It lives in the metadata directory. If it’s fine: done. If it’s not as expected: check the log for the metadata file. Assuming this is about o-charts-plugin-raspbian-armhf-10.xml: $ git log --oneline metadata/o-charts-plugin-raspbian-armhf-10.xml This should give a hint about what has happened to the file after 8c0a9a9 The private ssh key created by new-credentials is encrypted using a standard DES alghorithm. There is probably some room to crack this given the fact that part of ciphertext is known. The encryption would be stronger if the header and trailer of the key wasn’t encrypted. That said, given the context this should be reasonably safe. At least, a separate ssh key is used for this purpose, a key which could be easily revoked. ← Shipdriver template overview","title":"Automatic Metadata Git Push","component":"AlternativeWorkflow","version":"","name":"Catalog-Github-Integration","url":"/AlternativeWorkflow/InstallConfigure/Catalog-Github-Integration.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The paid plan is not necessary. The extra features are not required for creating repositories for your plugin. This step is optional. A membership is not required to create repositories, but makes it possible to create them in the same area as some other plugins. However, creating the same repositories without being part of the organization works just fine. To Join Send an email to Rick Gleason, Jon Gough or Dave Register requesting an invite. This will then be generated by Cloudsmith. FIXME: email addresses needed… Good news! You’ve been invited by Rick Gleason (@rick-gleason) to be a member of the OpenCPN (@opencpn) organization at Cloudsmith. What can members do? They can see other members and visible teams, and inherit privileges from the org and team membership.. You’ll need to login to your account to accept or reject the invite: https://cloudsmith.io/user/login/ After you login you will automatically find the invite within the organization invites section of your user settings: https://cloudsmith.io/user/settings/orgs/invites/ Accept/reject the invitation: https://cloudsmith.io/orgs/opencpn/people/invites/fCRGknS1o0IX/ If you accept the invitation then your user account will join the OpenCPN (@opencpn) organization at Cloudsmith.

This gives member rights which allows setting up repositories on Cloudsmith for the tarballs and metadata files built by the virtual machines. Once the invite is accepted you will see the OpenCPN organisation details. Many repositories have packages already in place. As mentioned, this works in the same way if using the cloudsmith organization or not. Eventually, three repositories could be configured. The names are formally arbitrary, but usually named like Tidefinder-Alpha ur tidefinder-unstable: This is basically a scratch build repository. Tidefinder-Beta: The repository for beta builds. Tidefinder-Prod or tidefinder-stable: The repository for stable builds i. e., builds published to end users. The beta repository is not required, just using two repositories like stable/unstable also works fine. To create the repositories for TideFinder click the plus sign at the right of the screen. Enter the details for the repository starting with the alpha (unstable) repo. Repeat for the beta and prod (stable) repositories. Three repos have been created. Retention life of the repositories For repos within the Cloudsmith opencpn organisation it is possible to use the setting Artifact Lifecycle. Repeat for the beta and prod (production) repositories. Repos outside the opencpn organisation cannot use the lifecycle without a subscription (non-free). Any number of packages can be added to the repos. Tarballs and metadata files are retained indefinitely. Be aware that in this case there is a limit of 50gb storage. Also a bandwidth of 200gb a month applies for uploads. This is reset to zero at the start of a new month. While using Cloudsmith make a note of the API Key.

When the changes have been made to the plugin it is a good idea to make an untagged build. The builds will arrive in the Cloudsmith opencpn/tidefinder-alpha repository. The plugin can be tested for functionality by using the Import plugin… button in OpenCPN. Now a tagged beta build can be made. The tag name needs to include the word `beta'. For example `v1.2.5-beta' This build pushes the plugin tarballs and metadata xml files to Cloudsmith opencpn/tidefinder-beta. At the same time the metadata files are pushed to the auto branch of your GitHub OpenCPN/plugins fork repo. The beta build can be tested in the same way as the experimental untagged version. Use the Import plugin… button in OpenCPN. When you want the plugin to be added to the master catalog another tagged build is made. The tag name must not contain `beta'. For example `v1.2.5'. The source code for tagged builds, either beta or production ends up in GitHub TideFinder repo tag pages. The reason for using untagged builds initially is to avoid cluttering up this part of your GitHub repo. Unwanted tags can be removed using this technique Check that the builders pushes metadata to the OpenCPN/plugins fork $ cd plugins $ git remote update origin $ git fetch origin auto:auto $ git log --oneline auto~10..auto This lists the 10 last commit to the auto branch.

It has not changed the data in sources.state. A local build would then use the latest dev plugin commit, but if the website is built by Github Actions the existing (old) sources.state file is used. In this way the state of the plugins manual can be tracked, by the commits made to the OpenCPN plugins manual. So far nothing has changed the state of the repository.'.gitignore' prevents any local build docs files or sources files being committed to the repository. When the latest commits of all the plugins are needed source-state save is run. This copies the commit hashes from the plugin sources and updates the sources.state file. The next commit for the OpenCPN plugins manual will use the new dev plugin commits, if any. In addition an individual plugin manual can be added to sources and the sources.state file updated: source-state.sh restore [plugin...] source-state.sh update [plugin...] source-state.sh save Where [plugin…​] is the URL for the plugin. The plugin has to be already listed in sources.state. This will not normally be handled by the developer but by a maintainer of the OpenCPN Plugins Manual. A build of the OpenCPN Plugins Manual needs to locate and use the dev plugin repository. sources.state holds the data for the plugins and a new entry is needed in the list. Keep the list sorted! ├───manual │ │ │ └───plugins │ │ antora.yml │ │ │ └───modules │ │ │ ├───ROOT │ │ │ nav.adoc │ │ │ │ │ ├───pages │ │ │ index.adoc │ │ │ index-main.adoc │ │ │ index-beta.adoc │ │ │ index-all.adoc │ │ │ │ │ └───partials │ │ nav-all.adoc │ │ nav-beta.adoc │ │ nav-main.adoc Asciidoc nav- files in the partials directory are used to create lists of the plugins, which appear on the left hand side of the website page. They duplicate other lists but they are essential for the indexing of the different individual dev plugin manuals. There is one component in the manual, plugins. On the website it is possible to navigate the plugins component. Each component can have a number of modules. ROOT is an important module that contains the nav.adoc page that provides the link with the plugin pages. Nav.adoc is comprised of the partials directory files nav-main.adoc, nav-beta.adoc and nav-all.adoc which are used to construct the left hand navigation bars, which are edited as necessary. As an example the following lines were added when DR_pi was added to the master plugins: DR_pi https://github.com/Rasbats/DR_pi.git f88efae675945a7f1eb5b3cc33ddaa3ff560d52f - url: sources/DR_pi branches: master start_path: manual edit_url: https://github.com/Rasbats/DR_pi/edit/master/{path} The indenting is important. Follow the indenting already in use. Editing to add or remove a plugin from the index is done in the partials folder, because these files are \"included\" in both the left side navigation and the center display. Because we are working with a main plugin that has been released, the files nav-main.adoc and nav-all.adoc are edited. (The file nav-beta.adoc is edited for beta plugins. Authoring and General and Supplementary Information changes may require index changes in those sections but that is normally done by maintainers.) 'nav-main.adoc' is in the 'partials' directory of 'ROOT'. It contains a list of the main plugins displayed as part of nav.adoc (left side navigation) and is also \"included\" in the index-main.adoc file which shows at the center panel. === Navigation ... * xref:dead_reckoning::index.adoc[Dead Reckoning] image:managed_plugin.png[] ... 'nav-main.adoc' is in the 'partials' directory and is used for left side navigation index and is included with index-main.adoc file which shows at the center. * Navigation ... ** xref:dead_reckoning::index.adoc[Dead Reckoning] ... 'nav-all.adoc' is in the 'partials' directory and is an alphabetical list, appearing on the left hand side of the pages. * A - E ... ** xref:dead_reckoning::index.adoc[Dead Reckoning] ... Important: notice the reference 'dead_reckoning' is used and not DR for this plugin. This is the same text as entered for the title in the 'antora.yml' file in the dev plugin’s manual.

The git repository for the plugins manual framework is at https://github.com/opencpn-manuals/plugins Each plugin manual is maintained in the source repository, by convention in a manual top-level directory. For example, the shipdriver manual is maintained in the manual directory in https://github.com/Rasbats/shipdriver_pi When the overall plugins manual is generated it collects the different plugin manuals from their git repositories and generates a complete manual form these. This means that the responsibility for maintaining each plugin manual lies with the plugin developer. The manual in the manual directory is using asciidoc to format the pages. Most manuals are just a single page named modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc. An example is available https://github.com/Rasbats/shipdriver_pi/blob/master/manual/modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc The asciidoc files are easily edited with a text editor or something like VS Code. When edited they can be viewed with Firefox with the asciidoc extension. One can also do a local build and inspect the generated HTML Formally, the plugin manual is an Antora page. While backwards- compatible with asciidoc Antora adds some additions on top of this syntax, notably links to other pages. However, these additions are usually not useful in a plugin manual (although they are heavily used in the overall manual framwork).

And then I started asking myself some questions. The first question about the pi was: \"What is it\", the second \"Why should I want it\", the third \"How do I install it\" and so forth. My conclusion was that I probably would appreciate a standard framework (for each pi the same framework). Maybe something like this: What and Why Install Standard actions Options FAQ Explanation: What and Why What does the pi do Why can the pi be useful Install Where to get the pi How to install the pi Standard actions What are basic (standard) actions you have to do to make the pi work Example: “how to set up a Watchdog Alarm”. Options What options are there after performing the standard actions Examples: 1. Choice for a specific type of Watchdog Alarm (anchor, boundary, speed, course, deadman, NMEA etc.) 2. Choice for a specific type of alarm-signal (pop-up message, sound, command) 3. Setting various parameters (range in meters, degrees, time in seconds or minutes, speed etc.) FAQ This section is meant to deal with various questions that might arise when using the pi. Example: (Why) Can(‘t) I …….. ? Answer: …….. *The problem: The English language is spoken in many different parts of the world. And in different ways. I’m Dutch and (I think) I can write a bit of text in English. But what I presume to be a more or less correct usage of that language might be quite upsetting to a native English speaker. So: text can lead to miscommunication/misinterpretation. And to complicate things: OpenCPN’s default English is \"US\" English and therefore (I realize I’m not making friends in the USA now….) not quite \"the real thing\" either. The proposed solution: *Visualise. That means: less text (not so easy for me) and more screenshots. Less text also means: don’t try to write \"a lot of words\" for things that are already obvious and don’t need further explanation. *Example: We can write a whole story (equals \"lots of words\"…) about how to set up an anchor alarm, but another way to skin the cat is to visualize it by means of a series of screenshots. Like this: Setting up an Anchor Alarm in Watchdog-plugin: Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 Step 4 Click Anchor and OK Step 5 Edit the alarm. Fill in and click OK. For explanation of the different items: see text a to h Click Sync to Boat or enter Latitude and Longitude. ​ Sync(ronize) to Boat = alarm is set for the position of the boat at the moment the alarm is enabled.* Adjust Radius if 50 is too much or not enough. Radius = the distance in meters before the alarm is triggered. Automatically synchronize to the boat whenever enabled Tick the tickbox if you want the alarm to be set for every new position of the boat at the moment the alarm is enabled again. Leave unticked is you want the alarm to remain relative to the position in step a. Sound, Command, Message Box Choose one or more types of alarms. Browse Choose sound-file to be played (only when \"Sound\" is ticked). Repeat Alarm after .. seconds Adjust if 60 is too much or not enough. Automatically reset Re-sets the Alarm automatically after you have responded to a alarm. Graphics enabled Draws a circle around the boat, showing the radius.

It lets you download, install and keep up to date the navigational charts provided by various free governmental and other sources worldwide directly from within OpenCPN’s Toolbox. The Chart Downloader plugin is an Internal Plugin, always distributed with OpenCPN, no separate download is required. Source: Opencpn Internal Plugin Forum: Chart Downloader Forum The supported charts include both the raster and vector charts for the US waters provided by the NOAA, official raster navigational charts published by Argentina, Brasil and New Zealand (covering also huge areas of the Pacific ocean) as well as electronic charts of the inland waterways of the USA and more than a dozen European Union countries. Alternatively you can use manual installation but Chart Downloader is the preferred way to install and update charts for most users. The Chart Downloader relies on catalogs of charts. A catalog is an XML file containing the names of charts along with the most recent chart update date and time together with the URL of the actual chart data. Before being able to download any charts we have to configure and download one or more chart catalogs. The catalogs are provided by the agencies publishing the charts (NOAA and the Army Corps of Engineers in the USA) and by the ChartCatalogs project created by the author of this plugin. When a catalog is loaded the Chart Downloader automatically scans the existing charts on your computer looking for updated or new charts listed in the catalog. This is what the plugin looks like when first opened by clicking Chart Downloader The chart downloader has two sub tabs. First tab allows managing the catalogs of downloadable chart sets, while the second manages the actual downloads of individual charts from the currently selected catalog. The Select Catalog…​ tab is for Chart Catalog managemment. Some chart sources provide many different catalogs for the same set of charts. For example, in the USA, NOAA provides chart catalogs for each state, region and Coast Guard district as well as the huge complete set. There are also separate catalogs for raster (RNC) and vector (ENC) NOAA charts. The first step in getting new charts is to select the appropriate Chart Catalog, make sure you think first though - having everything is not always the best option to organize your charts, so especially in the US, consider using more smaller catalogs over the one with the complete set of thousands of charts. Click the Add Catalog button to open the dialog. There are catalogs for all the free chart sources worldwide known at the time of the release of this plugin. The catalogs are organized in a folder structure. Open each folder to see subfolders. Open subfolders to see catalogs. Select any catalog you like by clicking the catalog description. After selecting the catalog you want, the “Chart Directory” will be automatically filled in. This is the directory on your computer where the catalog and the charts for this catalog will be downloaded. If the recommended directory is acceptable click “OK”. First time users will find it much easier to accept this default. Otherwise you can use the “Browse” button to browse to another directory where you want the catalog and charts to be kept. Once you are happy with the Chart Directory click “OK”. In case you selected a path to save the charts not covered by the current OpenCPN configuration, the plugin configures it for you. You can check the configuration on the “Chart Files Tab”. For more details about managing your charts, you should definitely read Installing Charts. Now you will see the Chart Catalog listed in the Catalogs section. Note that it will say (Please update first) under the Released column. Click the catalog name then click the “Update” button. The Downloader will retrieve the catalog from the server. After the catalog is saved a list of charts will appear on the second tab labeled Download Charts…​. Each chart has a check box. If the box is checked then that chart is scheduled to be downloaded. Depending on the Preferences you selected earlier the boxes will be automatically checked. You can check or uncheck individual charts or use the right mouse button to check and uncheck groups of charts. The US agencies update their catalogs on a standard weekly schedule, related to the Notice to Mariners releases. The catalogs from the Chart Catalogs project are updated occasionally, without any fixed schedule. You should select the chart source and click the Update every once in a while to get the latest chart updates. You can select the charts to be downloaded by ticking the check boxes in the list of charts. In case you want to select multiple charts at once, right-click in Chart Window will show a context menu, allowing you to Select all Deselect all Invert selection Select updated Select newly released charts. You can configure the plugin to automatically preselect the updated and/or new charts after an update of the chart catalog in the preferences. In addition to the right-click chart selection, you can Highlight a chart, then use “Spacebar” to check or uncheck. Then hit the down or up button and repeat. This is faster than Mouse clicking for groups of files. After selecting the charts for download, click the “Download selected charts” button to start downloading the charts. It can be a lengthy progress and a dialog box showing progress will pop as each chart is downloaded. If any charts do not download correctly a warning will pop up at the end. The status of the charts that have been downloaded successfully will change to Up to Date. Sometimes a slow or flaky Internet connection will cause a chart not to download and the status will remain the same. You can just click the Download selected charts button again give them a second chance. A recent improvement is the use of a separate CPU thread (when it is available) for downloading charts. Chart Folder Tab and Chart Group Tab reminder. A reminder box will pop up to tell you that you have to notify OpenCPN where to find the charts. We’ll do that in the next step. Upon Closing the Chart Downloader will automatically complete a Scan and Database Rebuild of the Chart Database, so the charts will be ready for use. For vector charts, one sensible step remains. Go to Options→Charts→Chart Files and press the button Prepare all ENC Charts. This will preprocess all new vector charts and updates, and prevent delays when actually using the charts If you should see the dialog below please Update the internal chart database and the plugin will remind you about it with a dialog. For more details about managing your charts, you should definitely read Installing Charts. To make it short, go to Options > Chart Files Tab and tick the Scan Charts and Update Database checkbox and when you close the Toolbox using the OK, your newly downloaded charts will be scanned and made available for viewing. The button Show Local Files on the lower right will open your default file manager in a separate window, which allows you to check files and directories easily. You can customize the behavior of the plugin to certain extent. To access the preferences, select the Chart Downloader plugin on the Options > Plugins Tab and click on the Preferences button The Default Path to Charts option allows you to set the top directory for all your charts, used to construct the suggested locations for the chart sources you configure. The All updated charts and All new charts check boxes tell the plugin which charts you want to select for download automatically upon a catalog update. The Allow bulk update of all configured chart sources and charts checkbox adds a new button to the Chart Downloader Tab, allowing you to update and download all the charts you are managing using the plugin with a single click. The behavior of this function depends on the aforementioned check boxes - either it downloads only new or updated charts or both.","title":"Chart Downloader Tab","component":"opencpn-plugins","version":"","name":"chart_downloader_tab","url":"/opencpn-plugins/chart_downloader_tab/chart_downloader_tab.html","titles":[{"text":"Chart Downloader","hash":"_chart_downloader","id":1},{"text":"Links","hash":"_links","id":2},{"text":"A Few Basic Concepts","hash":"_a_few_basic_concepts","id":3},{"text":"Chart Catalogs","hash":"_chart_catalogs","id":4},{"text":"Chart Downloader Tab","hash":"_chart_downloader_tab","id":5},{"text":"Using the Chart Downloader","hash":"_using_the_chart_downloader","id":6},{"text":"Adding a chart source","hash":"_adding_a_chart_source","id":7},{"text":"Updating the catalogs","hash":"_updating_the_catalogs","id":8},{"text":"Selecting charts for download","hash":"_selecting_charts_for_download","id":9},{"text":"Downloading charts","hash":"_downloading_charts","id":10},{"text":"After the download","hash":"_after_the_download","id":11},{"text":"Checking the downloaded charts","hash":"_checking_the_downloaded_charts","id":12},{"text":"The Preferences","hash":"_the_preferences","id":13}]},"125":{"id":125,"text":"The Dashboard plugin is able to show quite a few instruments.

There are 2 parameters in the Dashboard→Preferences→Appearance dialog for damping of SOG and COG. A value of 1 means no filtering. Higher values mean ever slower response of the instrument. The max filter value is 100 which is pretty slow. This filter works almost exactly like a mechanical filter that uses an oil damped indicator dial. It will respond gradually to a change in course or speed. A typical filter value of 10 seems to work pretty well. Select these parameters as suits your use. These controls together enable the user to adjust the view of the dashboard to suit individual needs. Units Ranges and Formats Set the units to use, and the range of the speed dial. The Wind History Instrument needs some further explanations. The “wind history” instrument is meant to be run as a standalone (vertical) instrument. Just define a separate dashboard and add it as the only instrument. You can resize the Instrument with the mouse. In real conditions, it monitors around 40 min of wind direction (red), as well as wind speed (blue), showing a vertical time line every 5 min (the example screen shot is a full-speed VDR replay). The text on the top shows the current values, as it is displayed in the standard instruments (blue = wind speed data, TWS=True Wind Speed, red = direction, TWD = True Wind Direction). Here is an explanation of the text line, left side (see screen shot) TWS 7.5 true Wind Speed currently 7.5 kts Max 22.3 kts since 18::50 this is the max Wind speed in the visible graphs, i.e. the last ~40 mins Overall 22.3 the max wind speed since OpenCPN was started. Right side above TWD 357 degrees:: True wind direction currently 357 degrees The thin red/blue curves are the real direction/speed values, the thicker curves are smoothed values. Makes it easier to see trends. There is some logic included The instruments zooms automatically as much as possible, always trying to show the whole visible curve; Wind speed curve If your max (visible) wind speed is 10 kts, then your scale is from 0…11 kts (rounded upwards to the next full knot). In the screen shot we had a mx of 22.3kts –> scale is 0…23 kts. Wind direction The instrument scale shows/- 90 degrees of the currently visible data values, but is limited to a total of 360 degrees. If the wind is shifting through North (from 350, 355, 359, 002, 010, …) we’re shifting the curve as well, meaning that there is NO vertical jump in the data from 360 degrees –> 0 degrees, and we do NOT loose all the continuity in the smoothed curves ! If you should happen to have more than a full 360 degrees cycle of wind direction in the recorded data (if you sail through a couple of dust devils ), I limited the max scale to 360 degrees, meaning that the curve will run out of the visible area on bottom or on top of the instrument. Please note that you don’t have to have the instrument “open” all the time. Once activated as initially described, you can close it, and simply reopen it on demand. You don’t loose the curves, the instrument continues to collect the data. To make it visible again simply right click on an existing standard-dashboard, and click the “Wind History” Dashboard. In Windows, Night, F5, mode. The title bar on the floating dashboard window is a bit glaring (this mode is controlled by windows by way of a theme and is not possible to change from an application) . Dock the Dashboard into “docked mode” it will be less glaring. The best solution is to simply “dock” the dashboard window at night, either left or right. This brings the window decorations back under OCPN control, and we recently added logic to dim it in this mode. The dashboard plugin contains 3 instruments capable of displaying the time according to the preference of the user. GPS clock - Unmodified time provided by the GPS unit, if available. This value is UTC. Local GPS clock - Time from the GPS clock corrected by user defined timezone offset (see below) Local CPU clock - Local clock obtained from operating system On the appearance tab of the Dashboard preferences there is a setting for “Local offset from UTC”. The default is 00::00. When the 00::00 is selected th Local GPS clock will display time in the time zone of the computer running OpenCPN. If that is not what you want then you can selected any other offset in 30 minute increments up to/- 12 hours. The offset will be added to the GPS UTC time and the local computer time zone will be ignored. Sunrise/sunset are computed based on the date and lat/long from the GPS NMEA input data. They are not computed from the CPU clock or the ship’s position. So unless you have a GPS connected then the times of sunrise/sunset are probably not going to be right. It has always been thus. Nmea_Converter_pi can solve many compatibility or unit conversion issues. There are nine examples showing how the use NmeaConverter to adjust Dashboard output. Companion Plugin: Nmea_Converter_pi can solve many conversion problems.

The grib plugin is an Internal Plugin, always distributed with OpenCPN, no separate download is required. Source: Opencpn Internal Plugin Forum: Grib Weather Forum Grib_pi supports template numbers: 0, 10, 30 & 40 from this specification: https://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/docs/grib2/grib2_doc/grib2_table3-1.shtml If you are not familiar with grib weather files, make sure you understand the basics, before you start to use them. It is essential to understand the limitations of weather forecasts that are distributed in the grib format. It is also worth pointing out that gribs are not reliable near tropical systems. Send a blank mail to \"GribWarning(at symbol)saildocs.com\". Read the mail you get back carefully. To get started with gribs and to find sources for downloads, check Franks-Weather. A very good, up to date book, is “Modern Marine Weather, second edition” by David Burch, with a thorough treatment of the subject. OpenCPN can read both the original gribfile format, known as Grib1, as well as the new Grib2 format, with the .grb2 or .grib2 file-extension. OpenCPN Grib_pi has been updated to support all of the useful GFS parameters (Sept 2021). The WW3 model has been incorporated into the GFS, so we get waves now along with the wind and pressure (and reflectivity)… plus the waves go out 16 days and not just the 8 of WW3, and the resolution is now 0.25º and when it was 0.5 before. To learn more about the various grib formats and models available, see: Grib School by Davd Burch Luckgrib NBM announcement Luckgrib probability for the results To display grib files as an overlay on your normal charts you have to first activate the grib icon Go to Find the plugin tab. Click on the Grib plugin, then the “Enable” button. The “Preferences” Button brings up a small dialog. The settings in this dialog rarely needs changing after the initial setup. Use High Definition Graphics. The setting only concerns the barbed wind arrows.Tick the “Use High Definition Graphics” box, unless you are on old hardware. Not ticking the “High Definition Graphics” box can help to speed up the grib display on a slow computer. Use Gradual Colors. This setting applies to all colored overlay maps. On many installations the difference in rendering is very small. The overlay maps built in color variation plays a part. Copy First Cumulative Missing Record. This is about rainfall and cloud cover records. As these records are “cumulative” the first one does not exist in files from zyGrib and Saildocs. With this parameter unchecked, there will be neither rainfall and nor cloud cover displayed for the first date/time of the file. Ticking the box fixes the problem. Copy Missing Wave Records. This only concerns wave records from zyGrib delivers files from two models ; FNMOC (WW3-…) for waves and GFS for all other parameters. These two forecast models does not have the same time spacing. For some dates/times, the wave data do not exist.This parameter allows this missing data to be reconstructed and avoiding the overlay (if set) to flicker. Load the More Recent File in Directory. Loads the newest file in the grib directory on start. Load the Last Open File. Loads the grib file used last time. Important Start at the first forecast in GRIB file Start at the nearest forecast to current time Authorize interpolation to start at current time. Local Time UTC To start the Grib plugin press the The “GRIB Display Control” then pops up. Hide Data at Cursor This is a smart and compact dialog. For a quick start press the “Open File” button and navigate to your grib file directory and press the file to be displayed. Previous/Next Go to the previous or the next record in the gribfile. This corresponds to the time “interval” chosen when the grib file was downloaded. Data valid at The time of validity for all grib data on screen. Open Grib file The name of the grib file in use. Now Displays the record, nearest in time to “now” according to the Start option you have selected: (“Start at the nearest forecast to current time” or “Authorize interpolation to start at current time”). Select Geopotential Height If grib data for geopotential height is available, selection will be between Std, 500. Zoom to Center This button will home in on the loaded area that the loaded grib file covers. Play Goes through all records in turn, with the animation speed controlled in the “Grib Settings” dialog. Hide Cursor Data Hides Grib which normally appears in the data windows. Data windows are hidden. Progress Slider Just to the right of the “Play” button is a slider that is just another way of going through the grip records. Open File Activates the operating systems standard file selector dialog to select a grib file. The plugin remembers the directory of this grib. This is used next time you start OpenCPN and activates the Grib plugin. See settings in the “Grib Preferences” dialog above. Settings is where to control how the different grib data will be displayed. See more below. Request Download grib files via email. More below. GRIB Data at Cursor. This is where the “smart” part kicks in. Only entries for the data contained in the active grib file will be displayed. For example, if there is no wave data in the current grib file, there will be no signs of wave data at all. In the case above, where the the wave data is N/A, the grib file includes wave data, but not for the area where the cursor is. Compare with the picture below, where the grib only contains current data. The tick boxes next to each data entry, are used to activate the data-display on the screen. Exactly what will be shown is controlled in the “Grib Settings” dialog, which is reached by pressing the “Settings” button. Don’t activate to many display features at the same time. The display quickly becomes very cluttered. The “GRIB Display Control” loaded with a grib file only containing current data. Advanced GRIB Data at Cursor. The display options for all the data shown, can be reached by right.clicking on the little squares where the “ticks” are shown. For the meaning of all these options, read on. Right-clicking the “Air Temp” option square. The plugin has an advanced mode were altitude data can be displayed. This mode requires some more knowledge than plain gribs. A good start is to read https://vos.noaa.gov:443/MWL/dec_08/milibar_chart.shtml [Mariner’s Guide to the 500—​Millibar Chart] If a grib file includes altitude data, the control will automatically include more options. See below. If the dialog looks normal except for an extra selection box under “GRIB Data at Cursor”, like this, Then the grib file contains altitude data. Selecting one of the altitudes, for example 500, changes the dialog to what you see above. The advanced data are displayed against a yellow background. Wind. These are the wind data valid for the selected altitude level. Grib Data at 500 hPa. The values at the selected level. Right click on Pressure and select what you want. Once a grib file is loaded in the current session, the “Weather table” appears in the right click menu. Click the entry, and a Weather Table, valid at the cursor point, pops up. All available data in the current grib file, for the whole time span, are shown. NOTE: To change the Wind & Wave Arrows to Degrees, just hit the Dir switch. …controls how the grib files are displayed on the screen, and units used in the Grib Display control. Things like overlay colors, animation time interval and speed and much more. The basic dialog looks like this. Typical DATA TAB Note the Fixed or Minimum Spacing (pixels) selection. This is a typical setting. Typical GUI TAB Typical PLAYBACK TAB The Loop Mode controls what happens when “Play” is pressed in the Grib Display Control. Loop Mode. Sets the “Play” function into a loop mode. Otherwise, playback will stop when reaching the end of the file. Loop Start. Were to start the loop. The option “Current time forecast” makes sure that only data now or in the future are shown Updates per Second. Controls the speed of “play”. Loop Start. The loop can start either at the start of the grib file or from the current time forecast. Interpolate between gribs. If you select this option, you will be able to choose your own time interval, but you have to consider that it can decrease data accuracy. To remind you, this info will pop up. Time Interval. This is the time interval used for interpolation. The entry is only visible if “Interpolate between gribs” is ticked. This is connected tho the chosen time interval when requesting a grib file. The lower part of the Grib Settings Dialog, under the Display heading is really 10 different controls. The controls are activated by the choosing one of the items in the selection menu below. Many of the entries are repeated, so lets first have a closer look at the the most important one, the Wind. Entries on the same line are connected. Units refers to the choice of units for the selected record. For wind speed the choices are. Barbed Arrows Display the traditional barbed arrows, showing wind direction and wind speed. Range refers to the distance between displayed arrows (not working 3.3.1117). Default Color/Controlled Colors Default is dark brown while “Controlled” varies from blue for very light winds to red for very strong winds. Always visible This option only exists for “Wind” and “Pressure”. When ticked the object is shown regardless of what is ticked in the “Settings Control”. The idea is to be able to Show wind and/or pressure at the same time as other options. Use with Rainfall, for example, to help identifying fronts. Display Isotachs shows contour lines connecting points with the same wind speed. Spacing controls which wind speed Isotachs will be shown. Use knots for units and 10 for spacing and isotach contours will be shown at 10 kts, 20kts and so on. OverlayMap Depending on your system capability,if you use “Accelerated Graphics (OpenGL)” (see General Options/Display/Advanced), the overlay will be visible at all scales. But if you don’t, the overlay will only be visible at small scales. A small yellow pop up at the bottom left of the screen will inform you. Zoom out to a scale of 1:13 millions, or smaller to see them. Colors is another selection menu containing pre-set color schemes. The idea is to use the scheme with the same name as the control, but this is just a hint, nothing more. Numbers shows the wind speed in small square boxes. Minimum Spacing refers to the spacing between these boxes. Particle Map is a kind of animation of the wind field. It is created by letting “particles”, or dots, move in the wind direction and leave a trail. The trail is colored after the wind strength, and each particle has a limited “life span”. The Density slider creates particle trails that are shorter but closer together with increased value, which is the same as further to the right. The particle Map below clearly shows a convergence zone with stronger winds (red). This is probably a cold front. Performance Warning: Note that high density Particle Maps on Low Powered Machines and Large Files may slow your machine to a crawl. First test on small files. Overlay Transparency works as expected. All the controls for Wind Gust, Rainfall and Cloud Cover, have similar entries; only the units differ. The pressure display has no overlays, only the options of isobars and numbers. Overlay Transparency is redundant. Waves and Current have a more or less similar display. A Particle Map is available for currents. See the descripion above for wind Particle Maps. Once again different units. There is a choice between three different display arrows shown in two sizes. If wave height, direction and wave period is present in the grib file it will be displayed in the Display Control like this: Air Temperature and Sea Temperature looks the same. Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) has these settings Altitude and Relative Humidity have a simple one choice entry. Grib files can be requested directly from the plugin. The request is in the form of an email to SailDocs or ZyGrib. The requested grib file is also delivered via email as an attachment. The area for which data is requested defaults to the area visible on the screen, but the request area can be selected by other means as well. See more below. It’s possible to request gribs from 4 different Grib prediction models when using Saildocs GFS, COAMPS, RTOFS and indirectly WW3. When you request “Waves” in GFS, Saildocs merge wavedata from WW3 into the delivered grib. The ZyGrib option can only deliver GFS gribs, which is the “standard” model for gribs. RTOFS gribs only contains current and water temperature data. COAMPS delivers wind and pressure with a higher resolution than GFS The minimum times between grib records are 3h for GFS and 6h for COAMPS & RTOFS. GFS can be requested for 8 days ahead. An extended GFS request up to 16 days ahead is possible. This warning will pop up. The same value for COAMPS is 3 days and RTOFS 6 days. There are two layouts of this dialog, depending on whether it is a request to SaiDocs or to ZyGrib. Some alternatives are only available from SailDocs, and some are only available from zyGrib. Alternatives not available are grayed out. Compose the request by picking parameters and data. Not all data are available for all choices of parameters. For example, in the picture above “Wind Gusts” and “Current” are grayed out, as the are not available with GFS from SailDocs. When selecting “Moving Grib” the dialog expands and makes it possible to choose a speed and course. The selected grib forecast area will move, using these values, for each grib interval. The idea behind this is to minimize the download while still covering a longer passage. Moving grib files are incompatible with interpolation, so if a “moving file” is detected a warning is displayed. Interpolation, if set is deactivated, but only for moving file, the settings as such, are not modified. Resolution The choices are 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0. A recent upgrade to gribs makes it possible to download even 0.25° resolution. This is not yet an alternative in the plugin and requires editing the email manually before sending. In the picture above …|0.5,0.5|… should instead look like …|0.25,0.25|… The default geographical coverage of the requested grib file is the area you can see on the screen. A manual Selection Mode is also available. When the Area Selection → Manual Selection box is ticked the dialog expands Choose the limiting Latitude and Longitude for the grib-file manually or press “Start graphic Sel.” button. Press the left mouse-button and draw a rectangle around the required area. When selecting “Pressure Altitude” and the GFS forecast model, the dialog expands and makes it possible to choose forecasts for different altitude levels. The SailDocs dialog only supports the 500 mb altitude, while zyGrib suports all options. When you are ready press “Send”. This message will show in the “Mail” window instead of the “send” request: Your request is ready. An email is prepared in your email environment. You have just to verify and send it...

The pick Open and the two grib files will be opened. Both grib files will be used by Weather_routing. In grib_pi settings I always use the “Current” “Proportional Arrow” Refer to the weather routing plugin for the use of two Grib Files (Wind Current)] There are many aspects to the use of grib files which lead to the use of other companion programs or plugins. ZyGrib is a free and open-source software (FOSS) dedicated grib viewer. Grib files can be downloaded by ZyGrib and then opened in OpenCPN. Opengrib Other sources of gribs, also a grib server. Download Mediterranean Grib Files Weather-Routing tools use Grib_pi and Grib data to create optimized routing based on boat performance files. OpenCPN has an excellent weather_routing plugin which works in concert with grib_pi and climatology_pi concurrently, so that grib files are extended by Climatology’s monthly averages for planning long voyages. * https://www.meltemus.com/index.php/en/, is another FOSS weather routing program, combines a grib file with boat polar data, and produces an optimized route. These are very good tools to use in routing decisions, but they all have the same limitations as all grib-data. (These notes are from the SailDocs Grib Server) This grib file is extracted from a computer forecast model. While such computer data can provide useful guidance for general wind flow, there are limitations which must be understood. What you are receiving is a weather prediction generated by a computer run by NOAA/NCEP (GFS, WW3 models) or the US Navy (comaps, nogaps) and downloaded and processed by Saildocs (a service of Sailmail). The network is complex, and any computer network is subject to hardware and software failures or human error which can effect accuracy or availability of data. In particular, if our servers were not able to download a current data file then the grib-file may be based on old data. The file information is shown above and also contained in the file itself. Also remember that grib data is not reviewed by forecasters before being made available. You are getting a small part of the raw model data that the forecasters themselves use when writing a forecast, and it is your responsibility to make sure that the data is consistent with your local conditions and with the professionally-generated forecasts (e.g. text bulletins and weather-fax charts). Grib data also has limitations along shore, where local effects often dominate and may not be adequately modeled. In addition these models cannot provide adequate prediction for tropical systems, frontal activity or convergence zones. For example, while global models can provide useful data on the likely track of hurricanes, they grossly underestimate the strength of hurricanes because of their small size compared to the model grid. For hurricane/cyclone forecasts, carefully monitor the appropriate warning messages and do not rely on grib data from any source. Grib data can provide useful guidance not available elsewhere. Understand the limitations and use the data carefully. Grib data should be considered supplemental to other forecasts, and not be relied upon in lieu of professionally-generated charts or forecasts.

When clicking on “send” button : if the “main” mail system is not open, OpenCPN opens it and the waiting messages are received. remark : if there are many waiting messages, it could take a while. That is why it would be better to create a specific address for this purpose. Then a new mail page is opened with all mail elements already written thus ready to be sent. How to install and configure sSMTP: 1) Install the ssmtp package. If another MTA is already installed, you may be asked to uninstall it before installing ssmtp. Once it’s done you can test it by typing this command: “whereis sendmail” The answer should be something like “/usr/sbin/sendmail”. Use that answer in the next command: “ls -la /usr/sbin/sendmail” If everything is OK you should get this answer: “/usr/sbin/sendmail → ssmtp” showing that Sendmail function is now connected to ssmtp. 2) Now there are two files to set: the first file : /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf ( with root rights ) The typical setting should be: root=postmaster AuthUser=yourlogin to your ISP access AuthPass=yourpasseword to your ISP access mailhub=yourISPserveurname.yourdomain (for example smtp.orange.fr) rewriteDomain=yourdomain FromLineOverride=YES hostname= the full host-name ( normally automatically entered, but if not you can type the command : “hostname” to get it) For ISP requiring a TLS connection , it could be necessary to add the line UseTLS=YES or UseSTARTTLS=YES the second file : /etc/ssmtp/revaliases (with root rights) Enter this line. root:yourlogin@yourdomain:yourISPserveurname.yourdomain the default port was 25 but now many ISP refuse it and use 587. If you have a mail system, you will find the right value in it.sudo dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config Sendmail/Postfix install for Mac - Inside OpenCPN :You must enter the sender address : your entire mail address, the one you will use to send mails and receive answers When you click on the “send” button, the mail is directly sent. You can find the log here : /var/log/mail.log First install Exim4 $sudo apt-get install exim4 then configure it (again). $sudo dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config This is a very simple setup where exim is just used to forward mail to the ISP:s smtp server. Local system mail is also available. It’s important to use the choice above. I just use “localhost”. We have no incoming connections. We are not using this. We are not using this. This is important. It must point to your Internet Service Providers SMTP server. Your choice! RTFM and make up your mind. Not a big deal for this simple setup. RTFM. Your Choice, but no point in splitting this simple setup. Edit /etc/exim4/passwd.client so it contains your username and password to your ISP:s mail server. # password file used when the local exim is authenticating to a remote_PARATABLE_INS_# host as a client._PARATABLE_INS_#PARATABLE_INS_# *see exim4_passwd_client(5) for more documentation*_PARATABLE_INSPARATABLE_INS_# Example:_PARATABLE_INS## target.mail.server.example:login:password_PARATABLE_INS_# for OpenCPN you can use *:login:password_PARATABLE_INS_*:fakexyz123:madeupXYZ123 (Re)start Exim4 $ /etc/init.d/exim4 \\{start|stop|restart|reload|status|what|force-stop} Start testing It is not so easy to install this on a Mac since you will need some experience with terminal using. The example below uses an googlemail account and nano as editor: Step 1 Type in terminal these 6 lines one after another with return: sudo mkdir -p /Library/Server/Mail/Data/spool sudo gzip /usr/share/man/man1/\\{postalias.1,postcat.1,postconf.1,postdrop.1,postf ix.1,postkick.1,postlock.1,postlog.1,postmap.1,postmulti.1,postqueue.1,postsuper.1,sendmail.1} sudo gzip /usr/share/man/man5/\\{access.5,aliases.5,bounce.5,canonical.5,cidr_table.5,generic.5,header_checks.5,ldap_table.5,master.5,mysql_table.5,nisplus_table.5,pcre_table.5,pgsql_table.5,postconf.5,postfix-wrapper.5,regexp_table.5,relocated.5,tcp_table.5,transport.5,virtual.5} sudo gzip /usr/share/man/man8/\\{anvil.8,bounce.8,cleanup.8,discard.8,error.8,flush.8,local.8,master.8,oqmgr.8,pickup.8,pipe.8,proxymap.8,qmgr.8,qmqpd.8,scache.8,showq.8,smtp.8,smtpd.8,spawn.8,tlsmgr.8,trivial-rewrite.8,verify.8,virtual.8} sudo /usr/sbin/postfix set-permissions sudo chmod 700 /Library/Server/Mail/Data/mta Step 2 Type in terminal another command to start the nano editor with this file: sudo nano /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd Type into the nano editor: smtp.googlemail.com:587 YourAccountname(the at symbol)googlemail.com:YourPassword Substitute YourAccountname and YourPassword with your data. Save the file in nano with Ctrl-O and exit with Ctrl-X. Step 3 Publicate the new file in terminal with this command: sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd Step 4 You have to edit the main config file and add at the end the following lines with this command in Terminal: sudo nano /etc/postfix/main.cf This to add: # Minimum Postfix-specific configurations. mydomain_fallback = localhost mail_owner = _postfix setgid_group = _postdrop relayhost=smtp.googlemail.com:587 smtp_sasl_auth_enable=yes smtp_sasl_password_maps=hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd smtp_sasl_security_options= smtp_use_tls=yes smtp_tls_security_level=encrypt tls_random_source=dev:/dev/urandom Save the file and exit nano as in step 2. Step 5 Now you can start postfix in terminal with: sudo postfix start If an error occurs correct main.cf and start again with: sudo postfix reload Step 6 Now you can test your work in terminal with: date | mail -s test YourAccountname(the at symbol)googlemail.com Done. Supplemental If you want to have started sendmail/postfix each time you start you start your machine you can add these lines to the launch daemon: RunAtLoad Do this with this command in terminal: sudo nano /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist After that this file should look like this: Label«/key> org.postfix.master Program /usr/libexec/postfix/master ProgramArguments master -e 60 QueueDirectories /var/spool/postfix/maildrop AbandonProcessGroup OnDemand/lt;/key> RunAtLoad Instead of googlemail in this example you may use any other mail server.","title":"","component":"opencpn-plugins","version":"","name":"mail_servers","url":"/opencpn-plugins/grib_weather/mail_servers.html","titles":[{"text":"Mail Servers","hash":"_mail_servers","id":1},{"text":"Warning!","hash":"_warning","id":2},{"text":"Windows MAPI Mail Server Setup","hash":"_windows_mapi_mail_server_setup","id":3},{"text":"Windows 10 or 8.1 and Thunderbird","hash":"_windows_10_or_8_1_and_thunderbird","id":4},{"text":"Windows Vista or XP and Thunderbird","hash":"_windows_vista_or_xp_and_thunderbird","id":5},{"text":"Linux","hash":"_linux","id":6},{"text":"Using SSMTP","hash":"_using_ssmtp","id":7},{"text":"Using Exim4","hash":"_using_exim4","id":8},{"text":"Mac OS","hash":"_mac_os","id":9},{"text":"Using Sendmail/Postfix","hash":"_using_sendmailpostfix","id":10},{"text":"Enable SASL authentication in the Postfix SMTP client.","hash":"_enable_sasl_authentication_in_the_postfix_smtp_client","id":11},{"text":"Enable Transport Layer Security (TLS), i.e. SSL.","hash":"_enable_transport_layer_security_tls_i_e_ssl","id":12}]},"128":{"id":128,"text":"dAISy AIS Receivers Wireless AIS+GPS Receiver Comar Standard Horizon GX2200 Matrix AIS/GPS Dual use of existing VHF antenna, no expensive Coax splitter needed Instructions for connection to OpenCPN Digikey USB to RS232 Connector to use with the instructions For Vesper Configuration Instructions with Opencpn Also Vesper mobile OpenCPN Android App suggestion GPS, AIS Transponder, Wifi, Nmea2000, Nmea0183, Alarm, no screen Excellent Panbo Article on Vesper XB-8000 GPS, AIS Transponder, Wifi, Nmea2000, Nmea0183, Alarm, Screen & Filters OpenSource.

Watchdog (WD) - Uses OD entities and messaging to create a large number of useful alarms. Weather Routing (WR) - Uses OD Boundaries to create Avoidance zones. Squiddio - Optionally uses OD Layers to avoid use of Navigation WP and POI. OD, WD, WR and Squiddio are separate plugins. In OD you can draw geo-referenced objects (lines, points, straight lined areas and circles). WD knows when and how to sound alarms. WR knows how to avoid boundaries. Squiddio has an option to use OD Layers which leaves the navigation layer cleaner. In OD, a graphical indication (crosshatching or shading) may be added to areas, to indicate whether these are intended to avoid (crosshatched inside) or to stay within (crosshatched outside), or whatever other meaning you want to give to those graphical indications. In WD you can select whether (certain types of) alarms should react only for areas that are flagged (in OD) as to avoid or to stay within, or for all areas. On top of that, in WD you can indicate whether this should be done only for areas labeled in OD as active, or inactive, or both. The WD Boundary Alarm has 4 different types: Alarm when approaching an area from outside (based on distance); Alarm when approaching an area from outside (based on time); Alarm to indicate whether your boat is inside or outside an area (Inclusion Alarm, another type of anchor alarm); Alarm to indicate whether AIS objects are present in an area. For the first two alarms the WD uses the same terms for the boundary that OD does as well as allowing a check for the state of the boundary. The third alarm only looks at a specific boundary which is identified by the boundaries GUID. The fourth alarm specifies a boundary to check if an AIS target is inside it. Beside the 4 types of Boundary Alarms mentioned above, WD has the following alarm functionality: Alarm when approaching coastlines (Landfall Alarm; 2 types: time and distance) Alarm when NMEA-data stream stops (NMEA Alarm) Deadman Alarm Alarm when distance to reference position exceeds a set value (Anchor Alarm) Alarm when course over ground deviates more than set (Course Alarm; 3 types: only port deviation, only starboard deviation or a general deviation); Alarms when speed deviates more then set (Speed Alarm; two types: overspeed for more than set maximum, and underspeed for less than set minimum). In total there are 14 different types of alarms. Technical aspects WD and OD are independent plugins. OD knows about drawing geo-referenced objects, WD knows how to sound alarms. Now the two can work together by passing and receiving messages, in this case JSON messages (basically a text string of elements and values). For the alarms, when WD needs boundary information, WD asks OD, via a message, whether a Lat/Lon is inside a boundary. WD can add further requirements asking for boundaries in a particular state and a particular type. Both the state and type are the same as what OD use i.e., Active/Inactive and Exclusion/Inclusion/Neither, or the inclusive “Any” (meaning any type and/or any state, not being as selective). In OD the boundaries checked are both an OD Boundary and an OD Boundary Point with range rings showing. Boundaries and Boundary Point Range Ring are both considered boundaries. The type of boundary applies to both, but the state (active/inactive) currently only applies to Boundaries, not Boundary Points. This is because there is currently no state for a Boundary Point. This may change in future updates to the plugins for consistency. When OD completes its check of Lat/Lon inside boundaries it replies with a single message containing the first boundary that the Lat/Lon is inside AND which matches the type and state requested. The response message contains the Name, Description, GUID, Type and State of the boundary found. WD uses the returned message to decide whether to sound the alarm and uses some of the information in the messages that are then displayed to the user, i.e. a change in text in the watchdog window and a message box, if requested. OD messages can be used by any plugin and OCPN itself to obtain information. For the OD messaging there is a “structure” for the content of the message, specifying the source requester, the type of message (Request/Response), the message i.e. FindPointInAnyBoundary, the message id (may contain an identifier for the source requester) and then the message contents, i.e. Lat, Lon, Type, etc. So a request looks like: Source: “WATCHDOG_PI” Type: “Request” Msg: “FindPointInAnyBoundary” MsgId: “distance” lat: 54.0001 lon: -30.1001 BoundaryType: “Exclusion” BoundaryState: “Active” This message is then given a “destination”, in this case “OCPN_DRAW_PI”, when the call to the OCPN messaging process is made. The response will look like: Source: “OCPN_DRAW_PI” Type: “Response” Msg: “FindPointInAnyBoundary” MsgId: “distance” GUID: “62ec7520-b58f-4087-b077-ae1c581dfec1” lat: 54.0001 lon: -30.1001 Name: “Rocks” Description: “Good fishing” Found: false BoundaryObjectType: “Boundary” BoundaryType: “Exclusion” Using this construct there are validation checks to make sure messages are valid to process. If they are not valid there will be error messages entered into the opencpn.log file with relevant information. OD is not concerned where the message came from or why, it will just respond to message requests with what is found from inspection of OD objects. WD just wants to know if it should sound an alarm or not, so it sends message requests to OD to determine certain conditions. WR just wants to know if the current Lat/Lon is valid for further processing or not, so it sends message requests to OD to determine certain conditions. AIS just provides information on each target it is dealing with. Now the check frequency in the WD alarm screen determines how often to check for a Lat/Lon being in a boundary. One other item which should be mentioned, is that for each boundary check based on time there are up to 11 Lat/Lon messages sent to OD, for each distance check there are up to 163 Lat/Lon messages to OD. Therefore the amount of this message traffic is something to watch. Please note that a JSON message does not have a “structure” per se, the message consists of element/value pairs written as delimited strings. The elements can occur in any order. So “structure” in the sense used in this document really refers to required elements. WR Weather Routing simply uses OD boundaries for avoidance, and it uses the same messaging as above. Squiddio simply has an option to use OD Layers instead of the OpenCPN Navigation Layer for WP and Marks.","title":"OD Plugin Messaging","component":"opencpn-plugins","version":"","name":"draw-messaging","url":"/opencpn-plugins/misc/draw-messaging.html","titles":[{"text":"Messaging between Plugins","hash":"_messaging_between_plugins","id":1},{"text":"User Perspective","hash":"_user_perspective","id":2}]},"131":{"id":131,"text":"General Terminology Plugin Installation OCPN Draw Messaging Supplementary hardware AIS Devices RPI Setups Supplementary software NMEA Tools Celestial Navigation Tool","title":"General and Supplementary Information","component":"opencpn-plugins","version":"","name":"misc","url":"/opencpn-plugins/misc/misc.html","titles":[]},"132":{"id":132,"text":"Developer Manual - Online Nmea Tools kplex Open source (GPLv3) software NMEA 0183 multiplexer for Linux, OS X and FreeBSD.

A necessary prerequisite is that OpenCPN is installed, this is not described here. There is official support for the following platforms: OS Platform Version Windows x86_64 Windows 7+ MacOS x86_64 10.9+ Debian amd64 stable, oldstable Ubuntu amd64 Supported LTS releases Flatpak x86_64, aarch64 runtime 20.08 Raspbian armhf 10 Android android-armeabi-v7a Android android-arm64-v8a Flatpak works on basically all Linux platforms and is the official support for Linux besides Debian and Ubuntu LTS releases. Note that there is no support for the various OS:es used on for example RPi 4 i. e., aarch64 platforms. Here, Flatpak is the only official packaging. All plugins are not available on all platforms There are two kind of plugins in OpenCPN: managed and legacy. Managed plugins is the newer variant. These plugins are handled within OpenCPN. The GUI allows installation, updates and uninstallation in a simple point-and-click interface. Legacy plugins is the older method. Such plugins are installed like any other program on a platform without using OpenCPN. Once installed, OpenCPN can use the plugin after a restart. Managed plugins are handled in the Options | Plugins GUI. Available plugins are listed in the catalog. This is updated when new plugin versions are released, which happens quite often. The first step when using managed plugins is to refresh the catalog With an updated catalog here is a list of plugins: In this list we can see all available plugins. The status is visible from various icons: Plugin is available for installation, but yet not installed A system plugin, always available, cannot be uninstalled Plugin can be updated and uninstalled. If this is not checked, plugin is a legacy plugin which must be handled outside of OpenCPN. Plugin is (is not) enabled, see below. The installation or update is straight-forward. Click on a plugin, possibly find out more by expanding info on it, or just install it. If the plugin is an update to an existing plugin this is visible in the GUI. Using the command line first enable the opencpn PPA (if not already done): $ sudo apt install software-properties-common $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:opencpn/opencpn $ sudo apt update If the name of the plugin is not completely known, first search for it using: $ apt search opencpn-plugin This lists a long list of plugins. Select the one to install, using the findit plugin as an example: $ sudo apt install opencpn-plugin-findit Uninstallation and updates are done using the standard apt tools, see the operating system documentation for more. There is no support for Flatpak legacy plugins, here only the modern managed plugins are used. Windows packages are .exe files. These are available for download at the Download area The downloaded file is usually an executable ”.exe“ installation file. Click on the file and follow the instructions, use the default alternative on all questions. Once the plugin is installed, restart OpenCPN and proceed to enabling the plugin. Uninstall and Remove This always requires Administrative permissions. The recommended way is to navigate to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\OpenCPN [Version Number] and execute the Uninstall-[Pluginname].exe in that directory. As an alternative it is also possible to uninstall a plugin manually by: Navigate to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\OpenCPN [Version Number]\\plugins and simply delete appropriate [pluginname].dll file and [pluginname] subdirectory. Open the Opencpn.ini file in the C:\\ProgramData\\opencpn directory with a text editor and search for “plugins”, to find these lines [Plugins] - remove reference to the plugin. [PlugIns/[pluginname]_pi.dll] bEnabled=0 - Remove these lines. You will also find other lines with the plugin user settings, but these do no harm and could be left in place. Common Paths used by Opencpn Plugin Packages DLL and plugin subdirectory: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\OpenCPN [version number]\\plugins User Plugin Data: %programdata%\\opencpn\\plugins a. k. a. C:\\ProgramData\\opencpn\\plugins. Although there do exist legacy MacOS plugin packages they are not documented here. Recent MacOS has made these packages somewhat complicated to use, and the managed plugins offers a better alternative. When a plugin is installed is is disabled. This applies to both legacy and managed plugins.

Such a quantity may be represented geometrically by an arrow of length proportional to its magnitude, pointing in the given direction. [Dutch: vector] Velocity A vector quantity equal to speed in a given direction. [Dutch: snelheid (in een bepaalde richting)] North The primary reference direction relative to the earth; the direction indicated by 000° in any system other than relative. True north is the direction of the north geographical pole; magnetic north the direction north as determined by the earth’s magnetic compass; grid north an arbitrary reference direction used with grid navigation. [Dutch: noord, noorden, N] True North The direction of the north geographical pole; the reference direction for measurement of true directions. [Dutch: ware noorden, Nw] Variation The angle between the magnetic and geographic meridians at any place, expressed in degrees and minutes east or west to indicate the direction of magnetic north from true north. The angle between magnetic and grid meridians is called GRID MAGNETIC ANGLE, GRID VARIATION, or GRIVATION. Called MAGNETIC VARIATION when a distinction is needed to prevent possible ambiguity. [Dutch: variatie, var] Magnetic North The direction indicated by the north seeking pole of a freely suspended magnetic needle, influenced only by the earth’s magnetic field. [Dutch: magnetische noorden, Nm] Deviation The angle between the magnetic meridian and the axis of a compass card, expressed in degrees east or west to indicate the direction in which the northern end of the compass card is offset from magnetic north. Deviation is caused by disturbing magnetic influences in the immediate vicinity of the compass. Semicircular deviation changes sign (E or W) approximately each 180° change of heading; quadrantal deviation changes sign approximately each 90° change of heading; constant deviation is the same on any heading. Deviation of a magnetic compass after adjustment or compensation is RESIDUAL DEVIATION. Called MAGNETIC DEVIATION when a distinction is needed to prevent possible ambiguity. [Dutch: deviatie, dev] Compass North The direction north as indicated by a magnetic compass; the reference direction for measurement of compass directions. [Dutch: kompasnoorden, Nk] NOTE: Variation is the same as Declination See NOAA Geomagnetism and Wikipedia “Declination” (magnetic affects of the world) should not be confused with “Deviation” (magnetic effects of the ship). That is the reason we are using the word Variation exclusively, as Bowditch does, for clarity and lack of confusion. Nautical Acronyms The definitions below are for those terms commonly used in instrument systems and navigation. The abbreviations shown are those more commonly used and may vary from one manufacturer to another. The definitions likewise may vary. Route (RT) A route is a predefined path or passage from one point to another. Routes generally use a series of Marks or Waypoints at each course change. Waypoints are Location Markers with specific Longitude and Latitude. The Route Legs between the Waypoints each have a specific Course and Distance. Waypoint (WPT) A waypoint marks a specific location, coordinates, or Latitude and Longitude, often determined by GPS. A Waypoint could be considered the ending point of a Leg. Isochrones While calculating a Weather Routing the plugin will calculate the location of the boat for a given time interval (eg: 1 hr, 4hr, 6 hr or 12hr ) and an isochrone represents how far the boat willl sail in a given direction, based on the weather and boat conditions, for each successive time interval. Isochrones are like contour lines around the starting point. Think of them as showing an intermediate destination, and the calculated distancee traveled. Apparent Wind (AW) Wind speed and direction relative to the boat. Apparent Wind is measured in the frame of reference of the boat, which may be subject to boat movement through the water (propulsion by sails, engine, etc) and movement of the body of water itself (currents, tides, etc). Apparent Wind is relative to the boat. Apparent Wind Direction (AWD) Compass direction from which the wind is coming relative to the boat. Apparent Wind Angle (AWA) Apparent Wind Angle is expressed in angle to the bow of Ownship, in degrees to port or starboard of the Heading, as measured by the onboard wind instrument. Apparent Wind Speed (AWS) Wind speed relative to the boat as measured by the onboard wind instrument Average Speed (AVS) Average Boat Speed through the water. (Trip Log / Trip Time) Bearing to Waypoint (BTW) Compass bearing to active waypoint measured from the current position. Bearing Waypoint to Waypoint Compass bearing to a waypoint measured from the previous waypoint. Boat Position (POS) Latitude and Longitude of the boat Boat Speed (BSP or STW) Sometimes called Speedo Speed of the boat through the water as measured by the onboard speed transducer. Compass Course (CC) The course steered from the magnetic compass using adjustments for True, Variation and Magnetic Deviation values. True-Variation-Magnetic-Deviation-Compass (TVMDC) values. Course (CRS) Compass direction that the boat is moving through the water (HDG + Leeway). Note that the difference between CRS and COG is Current. CRS does not include the effect of current. Course to Steer (CTS) The course to steer to offset the effect of currents, wind and other factors. Speed to go (STG) Course Over Ground (COG) Actual Compass direction that the boat is moving over the surface of the earth. (HDG + Leeway + Current) “The actual course you are moving along at the moment relative to the fixed land, meaning actual direction you travel regardless of the course steered and temporary variations in heading around this course. Things that cause COG to differ from heading include: current, leeway, poor helmsmanship, or compass errors.” Often derived from GPS. Speed Over Ground (SOG) The speed actually achieved which includes the effect or current set (direction) & drift (speed), wind and leeway and helmsman errrors. Same as SMG. Often derived from GPS. Course Made Good (CMG) Is the course actually steered which includes the effect of current set (direction) & drift (speed), wind and leeway and helmsman errrors. Note we distinguish COG (course over ground) from cmg (course made good), as one being present dynamic value, and the other being past. The phrase “course made good,” can be used to refer to a single track line or to the combination of several course changes between two points. If i sailed 1 mile north and 1 mile east, i made good a course of 045. Or, if i tried to sail course 200 but was being set between 10 and 20°, then i might end up “making good a course” of say 214. The distinctions between terms is not often critical, but may help to clarify some communications. Speed made good (SMG) The speed actually achieved which includes the effect or current set (direction) & drift (speed), wind and leeway and helmsman errrors. Cross Track Error (XTE) The perpendicular distance from the direct route (rhumb line or great circle) between two waypoints to the current position of the boat (POS) Dead Reckoning, also Ded Reckoning (DR) Dead reckoning is the process of determining one’s present position by projecting known or estimated course(s) and speed(s) from a known past position, or predicting a future position by projecting known or estimated course(s) and speed(s) from a known present position. The DR position is only an approximate position. Drift (DFT) Speed that the water is moving. This movement may be caused by a number of factors, including; tide, ocean currents, river flows etc. Electronic Chart Display & Information System (ECDIS) An ECDIS is a computer-based navigation information system that complies with International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations and can be used as an alternative to paper nautical charts. IMO refers to similar systems not meeting the regulations as Electronic Chart Systems (ECS) Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC) An ENC is an official database created by a national hydrographic office for use with an ECDIS. An ENC must conform to standards stated in the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) Special Publication S-57 before it can be certified as an ENC. Only ENCs can be used within ECDIS to meet the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) performance standard for ECDIS. Ground Wind (GW) Wind speed and direction relative to the ground (same as landspeople’s true wind). Ground Wind direction is expressed in compass direction. Ground Wind speed and direction is also relative to boats anchored or moored and stationary relative to the earth. Ground Wind is used in weather forecasts and reports. Ground Wind Direction (GWD ) Wind direction relative to the ground (same as landspeople’s true wind). Ground Wind direction is expressed in compass direction. Ground Wind Speed (GWS) Wind speed relative to the ground. Heading (HDG, HDT, HDM) Compass direction in which the boat is pointed. The abbreviations HDT and HDM are typically used to distinguish between heading degrees true and heading degrees magnetic, whereas HDG does not infer either a true or a magnetic heading. Whether HDG displays true or magnetic values, will depend on sensor selection and system setup. Heel (HEL) Heeling Angle in degrees of the port/starboard inclination of the boat. Heeling angle is associated with the boat’s lateral movement, or Leeway Layline Theoretical COG that will be achieved if the current conditions (TWD, TWS, TWA, SET, DFT, BSP, HEL etc), remain constant. There are port and starboard laylines that represent port and starboard tacks (or gybes). There are boat laylines, which emanate from the boat, and waypoint laylines, which emanate from the active waypoint. They are used to indicate when it is beneficial to tack or gybe. Leeway Leeway is the angle between the HDG and the CRS and results from the lateral movement experienced by the boat as she moves forward through the water.. The empirical formula is that Leeway = -1 * k * Heel / BSP2. The formula itself is often called into question, especially with planning hulls. The k value, which is boat specific, will vary according to crew numbers and boat loading. Log (LOG) Record of distance travelled NMEA National Marine Electronics Association has several standards NMEA0183 and NMEA2000. Nmea2000 uses manufacturer PGN’s. Two Links for Nmea 0183 NMEA0183 Sentences and NMEA0183 Revealed Set (SET) Compass direction of moving water (In the direction of the moving water). This movement may be caused by a number of factors, including; tide, ocean currents, river flows etc. Speed Over Ground (SOG) Speed that the boat is moving over the surface of the earth or ground. Speed Polars Theoretical values for maximum BSP for a range of given TWSs and TWAs. Target (Boat Speed) (BSP) Theoretical values for TWA and BSP for a range of given TWSs that result in the highest VMG. It is derived from the Speed Polars. https://sailzing.com/velocity-made-good-vmg/ Track (TRK) A record of the ships position as it proceeds on its voyage. True Wind (TW) Wind speed and direction relative to the surface of the water. Sailors sail in the interface between air and water, therefore mariners' True Wind is relative to water and different from landspeople’s true wind. True wind is perceived when the boat is stationary in the water, but moving with the tide or current; similar to the wind in the plane of reference of a stick floating down a river. True wind is not adjusted for current, tide or leeway, and that is how Ground wind differs. True Wind Direction (TWD) Compass direction from which the wind is coming over the surface of the water. True Wind Angle (TWA) True Wind angle is typically expressed as angle to the bow of Ownship. Note that mariners use the expression Wind angle relative to the bow in degrees to port or starboard of CRS (some instrument systems do not consider leeway in the calculation of TWA and in this case TWA is the wind angle relative to the bow in degrees to port or starboard of HDG). True Wind Speed (TWS) Wind speed over the surface of the water. Velocity Made on Course (VMC) Speed achieved directly toward the active waypoint. The value of VMC changes the longer the tack. VMC decreases the greater the angle to the mark, until on the layline where it turns to “0” and then starts getting negative because the distance from the mark is increasing. Velocity Made Good (VMG) Speed achieved directly towards, or away from, the TWD. The average value of VMG is an indicator of optimum sailing angle, and should be used as a general indicator, however the skipper should be using Target Boat speed to sail at the optimum tacking angel. https://sailzing.com/velocity-made-good-vmg/ Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) ETA is not an accurate way to judge progress or performance in a tacking sailboat because it does not account for the greater distance sailed between waypoints. VMC (to Waypoint or Course) changes the longer the tack is (VMG decreases dramatically as the boat gets to the 'layline' for the mark, because of the increased angle from the mark) and VMG (to Wind) has similar problems because it is not relative to a destination. So these terms are not effective for sailing. Tacking Time to Destination (TTD) Calculates in advance how long it will take to tack (or jibe) a sailboat to a particular destination in particular wind conditions, including factors such as wind changes, currents, waves, boat polars, sail and boat bottom conditions. An approximation of performance. [From Sailtimer documents]. Tacking Time to Destination TTD may also provide a better measure of performance than ETA and VMG. Tacking performance is commonly judged by using Target boat speeds now. Time to go (TTG) Turn Rate The AIS class A “Turn rate” signal normally comes from a gyro or satellite compass. It’s not calculated by the AIS itself. Heading Rate Heading rate is the rate of the heading which is typically derived from a magnetic compass. This is the absolute orientation of the boat.

For Sat2Chart to run it needs the ooRexx interpreter installed on the machine (Paul used to work for IBM). Sat2Chart intallation checks if ooRexx has been downloaded and installed. If not you are prompted to do so. ooRexx is an interpreter language. That means the human readable source code is not compiled to machine code to an executable and this executable is started but the ooRexx code is given to the interpreter which translate it to machine code during startup.

Very interesting article, showing a good use for lidar. This shows why the World Magnetic Model plugin (WMM_pi) needs to be updated on a regular basis.. Source: Opencpn Internal Plugin Forum: WorldMagnetic Model Plugin (WMM) Thread Forum: WMMThread This plugin is all about the value of the magnetic variation. The value at your boat position, at the position of the cursor, and the rest of the world. Download and install the plugin. Go to Options–>Plugins. Press the “Enable” button. Then press the Preference button, and copy the settings below. Press OK twice. The WMM icon will now be found in your ToolBar. The numbers in the button is the variation at your position. Press the Toolbar Button and the small dialog below will appear on the screen. The first value is the same as in the button, the variation at your boat (gps) position. The second value is the variation at the position of the cursor. That is all you need to know to get started, and for most of your daily use. Need more details? Read on! World Magnetic Model Plotting allows users to cross reference the magnetic deviation values printed on many raster charts. Variation is the angle between true and magnetic north. Inclination is the vertical angle of the magnetic field. A compass is adjusted for the inclination in the intended sales region. If you buy a compass in Europe; it will not be level in Australia, for example. Field Strength is the magnetic field in nano tesla from 20000 to 66000. Currently the total field strength is shown, with no immediate practical use. Hopefully this will change to show the horizontal component in the future, that has an impact on whether the compass works or not, near the magnetical poles.

Please make a User Guide. More information is given in xref:opencpn-plugins:authoring:pm-plugin-documentation.adoc Easy work with ATT, published in REEDS or in Tide Tables, i’ve created small OpenCPN plugin. It allows to calculate tides on secondary ports having data from standard ports and differences of secondary ports how it is suppose to be done manually on paper. dea is simple: I want to simplify tedious part of tide calculation based on A.T.T. → calculation itself. Having REEDS for a given year, I do actually have most up-to-date calculation for most of ports and marinas, covered by the almanac. Problem is only the calculation. So far I can easily type-in the data for some standard port and differences for secondary port of interest, press “calculate” and get my tide for secondary port at given date. Agreed, further work on this tide (tide at given time, time or required depth and and and) has to be done manually, but for the beginning it is already something if one has tide for secondary ports. Input form of the plugin has a form and acronyms like it is in A.T.T or Reeds for simplicity. For further ideas would be collecting calculated data in some offline/online data base so that one has to type in tides and differences only once… but it is not done yet. This calculated/typed-in data could be shared via … some file in same git repository or via some online database - don’t know what is better. If some one wants to contribute → you are welcome. If plugin gets published on opencpn page/plugins → nice. if someone wants to take over its maintenance and further development (without removing essential part → working with Reeds/A.T.T ) → great (i don’t have much time to invest into it) Feature requests/comments/improvements suggestions i will read, but do not promise to react on them immediately ( i don’t have much time to invest into it)… only if they will be useful for my own usage while sailing… sorry for that. Added IO. Input once. Now one has to input data for standard or secondary ports only once, save it and it gets loaded by next start of opencpn automatically. Format of files is not stable yet. I have to make a round of field tests weather it is usable and check calculation. rgleason tests it on win as standalone build (I use linux and build within opencpn build system) Any another tests (on another systems/configurations) are welcome. Polish UX and behavior of all form elements Improve io format. Connect Standard and secondary ports. (issue: A.T.T. lists numbers of ports, REEDS - no.. ). Further ideas (which i might or might not do): Add some kind of exchange data of stored ports with community to make it downloadable. In this way data base of tide data from A.T.T. and REEDS will grow much faster and gets available for more people. Add support for tide curve for standard port, so one can do such thing like “at which time one has enough water depth to pass a barrier” or similar. … ATT is available as a managed plugin (PIM), which is the easiest way to install the plugin.

Note: Do not confuse this with the additional supplements that overlap the Ship’s radar screen on the OpenCPN screen. If you want a simple screen, showing only the AIS targets, AIS Radar could be just what you need. Note: In this section the instructions are specifically for AIS Radar-pi, but there is a dedicated page in the manual with information about Downloading, Installing and Enabling Plugins in general. That dedicated page can be found here AIS-Radar-pi can be installed directly from the OpenCPN GUI. It can also be downloaded from http://www.opencpn.org/index.html which has download links for Windows and MacOSX. B. How to install the plug-in Make sure you choose the file that is compatible with your computer system. In this manual we presume it’s Windows, so we choose the Windows setup-package. Download the file (double-click). We assume you know where to find the files you download from the Internet (if you don’t: quit now and read the manual of your computer before doing anything else with it Double-click the downloaded file and follow the set-up instructions. That’s it. But before you can actually use the plug-in, you first have to enable that plug-in in OpenCPN. Open (or restart) OpenCPN. Click Tools-Options-Plugins Scroll down untill you see the AIS Radar-pi. Click “Enable” and then “Preferences”. The list of preferences is simple: Show RADAR icon This box toggles displaying the icon in the OpenCPN icon bar. Use AIS as Radar Source. Ticking this box will allow AIS Radar View to use the information from your AIS receiver (make sure your AIS receiver is set up in OpenCPN in “Tools”-“Options”-“Connections”). Click “OK”. Now the AIS Radar icon should appear somewhere in your OpenCPN Toolbar. When you click the AIS Radar-pi icon, you will see a radar-screen like representation of the AIS-targets around you. They are represented by triangular ship-icons. Yellow if not fully recognized yet, green when fully recognized. When your own ship has not just an AIS-receiver, but an AIS transponder (and sends AIS signals), you will see such an icon in the centre of the screen. That’s you. On the bottom of the screen you can set some options. You can set different ranges in AIS Radar. From 0.25 nm to 32 nm. You can also choose “North Up” (when it’s not selected, the view will be “Course Up”) and you can select “EBL” (“Electronic Bearing Line”). With EBL selected, a mouse-click on the AIS Radar screen will give you a bearing in degrees. That bearing is always in degrees relative to North, not relative to your course. Two operating modes are possible: North-up, COG up, or “Course Up”. You can select “North Up” on the bottom of the screen. If you select “North Up”, you will see the text “North Up” in the right hand top corner of the AIS Radar Screen. If you do not select “North Up”, AIS Radar Screen will operate in “COG up” mode and you will see the text “Course Up” in the right hand top corner of the AIS Radar Screen. “North Up” is selected. You will see the text “North Up” in the right hand top corner of the AIS Radar Screen. Also you will see the letters “N”, “E”, “S” and “W”. They indicate North, East, South and West. The range is set to 8 nautical miles. The center of the screen, where the vertical and the horizontal axes cross, is your own position. All vessels with an AIS transmitter, Class A or B, within the chosen distance, will be displayed on the screen (“AIS-targets”) and their positions will be updated as they (and/or you) move. There is no ship-icon in the middle. That is because in this example you are only receiving AIS-signals and not sending them. If you would be transmitting AIS-signals, you would see a ship-icon (us) in the middle of the screen. If your boat does not send AIS-signals but you do see a ship-icon in the middle of the screen, you have rammed another ship! (maybe you should have set a Watchdog-alarm?) Note: the AIS Radar relies not only on the other ships sending AIS-signals, but also on your equipment receiving those signals! “EBL” (Electronic Bearing Line) is also selected. In the top left quadrant of the screen you see an AIS Target. It is the “Princ Zadra” coming from the North West. By putting the mouse-cursor on that ship and clicking, the EBL will tell you the true bearing of that ship from your position. In this case that true bearing is 312 degrees. It’s true, believe us. Any target that: moves towards the center of the screen is a boat that can “potentially”, collide with the boat of the user. moves away from the center of the screen, is a boat that presents no risk of collision with the boat of the user. If you do not select “North Up”, AIS Radar Screen will operate in “COG up” mode and you will see the text “Course Up” in the right hand top corner of the AIS Radar Screen. The next screenshot is the same situation as described in the part ” Mode “North up”, but now in “Course Up” mode. Note that the numerical value displayed at the top of the vertical axis gives your COG. In this case that numerical value is 306 degrees. That means you are heading North West. Also note that on the screen the “Princ Zadra” (which is coming from the North West) is now coming almost straight “down” towards you. Theoretically, in “COG up” the targets directly in front of your ship should be permanently oriented towards the top of the screen. BUT, also note that with each variation of your own COG, the entire screen rotates either in one direction or the other. It’s movements are non-existent if you follow a constant heading. Any target that: moves towards the center of the screen is a boat that can “potentially”, collide with the boat of the user. moves away from the center of the screen, is a boat that presents no risk of collision with the boat of the user. Keep in mind that the plugin has advantages but also some things to be aware of. The big advantage of AIS Radar is that it is not very complex. But keep in mind that the information on the screen is sometimes less than the information you will get in the “normal” AIS Target Information on the main screen of OpenCPN. We will illustrate that with a few screenshots of a ship approaching us from our port quarter. It’s a ship called “Eemshorn”. Looking at the AIS Radar screen you might think she is just an ordinary ship like any other ship. This is the info on the AIS Radar screen. But the AIS Target Information on the main screen of OpenCPN would give you some important additional information. In this case that she is a dredger and restricted in her manoeuverability. This is the info on the OpenCPN screen. And instead of the EBL in AIS Radar you could use an EBL made with the plugin OpenCPN DRAW (ODraw). This is the info on the OpenCPN-screen with an EBL made with ODraw.","title":"AISradar View","component":"aisradar","version":"","name":"index","url":"/aisradar/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Links","hash":"_links","id":1},{"text":"What and Why","hash":"_what_and_why","id":2},{"text":"A.

Route Position Bearing Standard Cross Track XTE -XTE multiplier Waypoint Bearing -by Distance or by Time Confirm Bearing change on Waypoint Arrival. Intercept Route on Current Course It has several other very nice features. Interface Note Keep in mind that this plugin does not have a normal toolbox icon or menu, it’s settings are controlled from the preferences menu. There is a proprietary PGN that allows setting the heading of the Raymarine EV-1 pilot when it is in auto mode. This is PGN 126208 with a data length of 14. In canboat format this pgn looks as follows: Z,3,126208,7,204,14,01,50,ff,00,f8,03,01,3b,07,03, 04,06,f0,3d The last 2 data bytes indicate the heading to be set in thousands of radials, least significant first (divide by 174.53 to get degrees). So the above will set a heading of 91 degrees. This is tested with canboat and a Actisense NGT-1 and functions flawless. The autopilot route plugin could easily be extended to emit this message. I cannot really implement it because I have no way of testing it. NMEA is a serial connection using the RS422 physical layer. While the 'S' in 'USB' does stand for serial it is an entirely different serial system. You will need a USB-serial converter for your laptop (unless your laptop has an actual serial port, most newer ones do not). Done properly you would get a USB-RS422 converter, but most systems will also work with the more common USB-RS232 connector. You will also need the driver for your operating system and the converter you select, not all are created equal so make sure your flavor of operating system is supported. After that the converter will appear as a 'COM' port in Windows and you configure O to output to that COM port. There are lots of other options, including adding a WiFi dongle to your Raymarine that means you don’t have to use wires, but those get more complicated. Pypilot works well itself. Autopilot_Route works itself and shows the right overlay but does not direct pypilot in any gps or compass mode. How does one use autopilot with pypilot or pypilot motor controller? The Autopilot_Route Plugin is not specific to Pypilot or any other autopilot. It replaces the nmea APB output built into opencpn with many more options for computing how this sentence is generated. It does output a continuously changing bearing in some modes which is no problem for Pypilot, but some autopilots might not allow it. I didn’t try other autopilots with the route plugin, but apparently some autopilots require confirmation on bearing change. So the apb must give the same bearing always and only after xte.

Activate it. Cast off. Put the ship on course. Press Auto on the Raymarine P70 pilot head. Pilot takes over as usual. Press auto again. Plugin takes control of the autopilot and will steer your ship along the activated route to your destination, and follows the route with a margin (XTE) normally less than 2 meters, independent of cross currents and compass errors. Caution: Only thing to do is keep a lookout for obstacles and traffic. As soon as you press Standby the autopilot returns to standby and you can steer manually again. When you press one of the buttons +/- 1 or 10, pilot will switch to regular auto on the last heading plus the button you pressed. Auto button when pilot is in auto activates the tracking again. Alternatively this may be handled from the plugin window on the OpenCPN screen, see attached image. The Auto, Standby and +/- buttons work as usual with your Evolution pilot. On top of this comes the Tracking button which is enabled only when a route is active. It will make you follow the active route as described below. Buttons are large for easy use on touch screens. To use the plugin you need an Actisense NGT-1 to connect to the Raymarine Raytalk-ng network, which is an nmea 2000 network with lots of proprietary pgn’s. Some of these are decoded to get access to the required functions. The current code (Windows only) can be found at https://github.com/douwefokkema/AutoTrackRaymarine_pi . This version works fine with OpenCPN version 5.2 and later. If you want to use this plugin, at https://www.dropbox.com/s/kh87usvy1otrrlp/AutoTrackRaymarine_pi-0.0.0-ov50-win32.exe?dl=0 you will find the installer for AutoTrackRaymarine_pi. In preferences, set the serial port number of your Actisense NGT-1. You may forget about the rest. For the technically interested, the plugin is using a PID based steering function that calculates corrections on the Bearing to Waypoint (BTW) based on the XTE as received from OpenCPN. It normally sticks to the route within 2 meters, on heading changes at waypoints it may overshoot a little. With large compass errors or strong cross currents, it may take a minute or so to settle down on the track. This plugin was inspired by and may use code from autopilot_route_pi, Autopilot-Plugin and Canboat (for controlling the Actisense NGT-1). Warning: this plugin may take full control of your autopilot. In case of system or software errors be ready to switch the autopilot off (never happened). This plugin also function as a remote control with the possibility to set the autopilot to Auto/Standby and to adjust the heading set. The wireless remote control that Raymarine provides is too expensive and rather old fashioned, connected through the old Seatalk with a converter that caused all kinds of problems. The Track function on the autopilot is difficult or impossible to use with OpenCPN. It needs data from O, but whatever you send it, after some time it switches off with a “No data” message. I have the impression it requires a Raymarine display to function. When the Raymarine track function does work, it behaves very erratically at startup, steering crazy headings for some minutes, then stabilizing on the right track. Further it requires confirmation at every waypoint, which is not practical when you have routes with hundreds of waypoints often very close together. To do a better job one needs to control the autopilot for at least the following functions: set heading, set auto/standby. I have decoded the communication of the autopilot with the pilot head and deciphered the proprietary pgn’s that perform these functions. With this I have build a plugin for OpenCPN that provides a remote control for the autopilot and a route following function. The plugin is using a Actisense NGT-1 for the communication with the NMEA2000 network of Raymarine. The plugin is also monitoring the keystrokes on the Raymarine P70 pilot head and acts on that to activate the route following. When the plugin observes that the auto is pressed while the pilot is on auto already, the plugin activates the route following. Further details on this plugin: Cruiser Forum - AutoTrackRaymarine_pi Remote control and route following for Evolution pilots Note: The PGN’s I am using to control the Raymarine pilot are proprietary and don’t have nmea183 equivalents. So I do not see how a SignalK server can do a conversion. Further I have no need of a conversion, my plugin is working and tested during a full sailing season. To follow a route I do not need the full route in the plugin. I just use the DTW, BTW and XTE for the current leg, that is sufficient to steer on track. Note: Reason I needed an update in O is that the accuracy of the XTE in the nmea183 message lacks precision.

Also, users may find this plugin, which is still under development, useful for cross checking their position fixes obtained in other ways, or to to better visualize a celestial fix. You find the forum thread here: Github Source: https://github.com/seandepagnier/celestial_navigation_pi Github Maintenance Source: https://github.com/rgleason/celestial_navigation_pi Plugin Download, Install and Enable: Instructions Forum: Celestial Navigation Plugin Redux Legacy Package Releases: Github Windows Releases Legacy Downloads: https://opencpn.org/OpenCPN/plugins/celestialnav.html Three types of observations are supported: Measure the angle between the horizon and a heavenly body, and enter the required data in the plugin. Each measurement results in a Circle of Position on the sphere (COP, or Circle of Equal Altitude). Two or more observations result in intersecting COP’s from which a position fix can be obtained. Measure the azimuth (bearing) of a heavenly body. This method is hopelessly inaccurate, especially on a small boat in high seas. However, it is interesting for demonstration purposes, and possibly - with accurate digital compasses - it may be a viable navigation method in the future. Measure the angle between two heavenly bodies. The computer then attempts to determine clock error from this measurement, and the system time may be corrected. Standard practice in navy and merchant navy with regard to celestial positioning is as follows (assuming no artificial horizon is available on the sextant): During morning nautical twilight (about 15 minutes): if possible take 6 star/planet observations. In the morning at about 09:00LT: take a Sun’s observation (later to be shifted to noon-time). At local noon: take a Sun’s observation (traditionally only direct latitude calculation from sun at meridian passage). Construct a fix for noon from both sun observations. During evening nautical twilight (about 15 minutes): if possible take 6 star/planet observations. Use the Moon for an observation in above practice when situation permits. Many books have been written about the art and science of celestial positioning (Resources below). Document containing the test data used for the example below: Example Worksheet PDF (4 star observations). Enter Type (Altitude, Azimuth, Lunar), Celestial Body, Limb, Measurement and Degrees of Certainty. Degrees of Certainty is the accuracy the navigator assumes for the observation. A larger value results in a larger line width for the Circle of Position on the chart. Enter Date (based on GMT/UT) and Time in GMT/UT, Certainty and Shift. Note that entering a shift removes the calculated numerical fix. This is due to the computation method used, which presently does not allow to shift COP’s. However, a position fix can be established by visually observing the COP’s (which are graphically shifted) on the chart. The date and time is populated using current computer time and time zone (verify your computer’s time), to match the Greenwich UTC Date & Time. Times for sights are entered in UTC. Sights are likely taken extemporaneously with time details, unique exact time for each sight must be entered separately, overriding the computer time & date. When a DR Shift with values > 0 is entered the Circle of Position will shift accordingly, the “Fix” button will not compute and the Fix must be done manually. The DR Shift is used to “advance” a sight to the time of last sight in a “group of sights” which have been taken at different times (usually 1-5 minutes apart), so that the fix can e more accurately determined. The navigator first measures the range and bearing of the sight that is to be “advanced” to the last sight of the group. These values are then entered into DR Shift and the program simply adjusts the Circle of Position to the time of the last sight of the group. The actual “Fix” must be done by manual inspection and dropping a waypoint at the selected location and labeling it “Fix” with the date and time labeled. Please see David Burch’s Videos: Methodology_with_Celestial_Navigation_pi below for a much clearer explanation. Enter Transparency and Color you wish to use for the COP. Enter Eye Height, Temperature, Pressure and Index Error. Showing the input figures and some calculated results for the observation. Together with the calculated numerical position fix showed in the main window of the plugin, this can be used for comparison with results that are obtained by other calculation methods (traditional manual method using logarithms, traditional or direct computation methods as mentioned in Nautical Almanac, shortened methods using e.g. Site Reduction Tables for Marine Navigation - US Pub. 229 Sight Reduction Tables US Pub No. 229 or Ho 229 - The Nautical Almanac US Pub. 249 or Ho 249 Epoch 2020 - The Nautical Almanac A Circle of Position (COP) indicates all the positions on earth where a navigator may observe the same altitude of a heavenly body at a certain time. Using traditional methods, only the part of a COP the navigator is interested in is used, and replaced by a tangent line (LOP). The MOB icon shows the initial DR position entered. The red circle indicates the intersection of the crossing red lines, the calculated position fix. Hover cursor over the crossing, right click and place a mark. If required, visually adjust this to get best latitude and longitude of the fix. In Sight Properties - Sight Tab, Degrees Certainty was set to 0.05. Videos by David Burch, Starpath Navigation https://www.starpath.com/index.htm This computer assisted process is a little different than traditional techniques because Circles of Position are calculated using the Simbad database for stars and lunar and the sight circles and intersections are neatly represented in the standard Opencpn interface. David Burch (Starpath.com) has completed a number of very informative videos for Celestial_Navigation_pi. Let him step you through the process visually, and you will learn the differences from traditional calculations as well. His videos: Video: OpenCPN Cel Nav Plugin Part 1 Working with two “Altitude” sights. Getting a “running fix”, entering parameters.

Many thanks to Henning Umland for this concise text. Naturally, the information provided by the Nautical Almanac and Bowditch is of interest, see below Celestial Navigation Links. The plugin is still under development and the computation methods used are innovative and based on vector, matrix and least squares methods. The author, Sean d’Epagnier, uses this innovative method to directly calculate a fix position. Only he knows the background and details. General information on direct computation methods can be found on pages 277 to 285 of the Nautical Almanac 1994 (See Celestial Navigation Links below) and in the following articles: New Computational Methods for Solving Problems of the Astronomical Vessel Position (pdf 1.7mb) The Direct Fix of Latitude and Longitude from two observed Altitudes (pdf 1mb) Generic Algorithm for Solving Celestial Navigation Problems (pdf 435kb) Presently, the plugin is not capable of advancing COP’s to a common time. When a shift is entered, the calculated numerical position on the main window disappears. In this case, the fix can only be established by visual examination of the graphics on the screen (also see above) 3. Sight Properties - Date and Time Tab and 9. Four Circles of Position. Website Under revision: aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/celnavtable.php[Celestial Navigation Data for Assumed Position and Time- Navy] From Clear Sky Institute refer to their github repository Astronomical Software Ephemeris The United States Naval Observatory (USNO) The data and formulae contained in the Nautical Almanac form a standard in itself. The plugin utilizes astronomical data from VOP87d (for the planets and indirectly for the sun), ELP2000/82 (for the moon) and contains Right Ascension (RA; star’s SHA = 360° - star’s RA) and Declination (Dec) data for the selected stars. During development of the plugin, the calculated (intermediate) correction values for dip, refraction, horizontal parallax, parallax in altitude and semi diameter, as well as the calculated position fix, should be compared to values that result from other computation methods. The astronomical data used in the plugin is more accurate than data taken from the Nautical Almanac. However, for navigation purposes the differences are generally not important. With regard to altitude reductions, so far test data indicates that the differences found in calculated observed altitude (Ho) are small. Measurement and reading errors made by the navigator will be larger. Using the present version, calculated fix positions can still differ from those calculated with traditional methods. The plugin astronomical data are from Jean Meeus' Astronomical Algorithms Wikipedia and Sourceforge. Planetary positions are based upon a truncated version of Bretagnon and Francou’s VSOP87 Theory (pdf) also see Wikipedia VSOP87 . The estimated maximum error in the heliocentric longitude is several arc-seconds. Geocentric positions are accurate to within a few arc-seconds. Lunar positions are calculated using a truncated version of the Lunar Ephemeris ELP 2000 - Lunar Theory ELP-2000/82 of Chapront-Touzé and Chapront also see Wikipedia - Ephemeride_Lunaire_Parisienne. The estimated maximum error in the geocentric longitude is about 10 arc-seconds. Note this repository github.com/variar/elp2000-82b. (The plugin code does not necessarily use this github repository.) The largest error that can occur in GHA and declination of any body other than the Sun or Moon is less than 0.2'; it may reach 0.25' for the Sun and 0.3' for that of the Moon. In practice it may be expected that only one third of the values of GHA and declination will have errors larger than 0.05', and less than one tenth will have errors larger than 0.1'. The errors in the altitude corrections are nominally in the same order (but the actual values of dip and refraction at low altitudes may differ considerably in extreme atmospheric conditions). Depending on the type of sextant, the reading accuracy of the sextant can be 0.2', 0.1' or 10“. Measurement and reading errors made by the navigator will be larger. This page allows you to obtain all the astronomical information necessary to plot navigational lines of position from observations of the altitudes of celestial bodies. Simply fill in the form below and click on the “Get data” button at the end of the form. A table of data will be provided giving both almanac data and altitude corrections for each celestial body that is above the horizon at the place and time that you specify. Sea-level observations are assumed. Very useful for study, testing and comparisons.

This update adds corrections for star sights. It uses updated star positions from the SIMBAD Astronomical Database. Positions are corrected for proper motion and parallax. Positions are corrected for frame bias, precession, and nutation. See: Github Pull Request #9 Cruiser Forum Post #377 Cruiser Forum Post #383 New files: transform_star.cpp has been written by me, using equations from the US Naval Observatory Circular No. 179 epv00.cpp comes from the SOFA library http://www.iausofa.org/, with a wrapper function written by Povl Abrahamsen. Also we would like to acknowledge the use of the SOFA function and library. See Article: Earth Rotation and Equatorial Coordinates below for general information about the error. We believe the current values should be usable for navigation - certainly within the accuracy that can be expected for a human holding a sextant on a vessel at sea. But clearly there are still some minor corrections required to get the exact same values as the USNO. Some abbreviations of terms are given in the list hereunder. Not all of these abbreviations conform to a standard. AP- Assumed Position- where you are or think you are based on Latitude and Longitude. COP- Circle of Position (Circle of Equal Altitude) Dec- Declination- the angle in degrees of a celestial body above or below the celestial equator. It’s analogous to latitude on earth. DR- Dead Reckoning Position (from Deduced Reckoning) HA- Hour Angle GP- Geographical Position of a heavenly body. It has two components; declination and GHA. Dec, or declination, mentioned above, is analogous to latitude on earth. In Western longitudes a heavenly body’s GHA equals the longitude of the GP. In Eastern longitudes the GP equals 360° minus GHA. If at a given point in time you were at the GP of a celestial body it would be directly over your head- your zenith. GMT/UT- Greenwich Mean Time and Universal Time. For celestial navigation work all observations are recorded in time and date based on Greenwich, England. GMT is also known as “UT”. GHA- Greenwich Hour Angle- the angular distance in degrees between Greenwich (0°) and a celestial object. GHA is always measured West of Greenwich. LHA- Local Hour Angle- the horizontal angular distance in degrees between the Ap (Assumed position) and a celestial object. It is always measured West from the Ap. to the celestial object. LOP- Line of Position MPP- Most Probable Position RA- Right Ascension (star’s SHA = 360o minus the star’s RA) SHA- Sidereal Hour Angle D-R-I-P-S Dip of the Horizon (function of eye height) R- Refraction (function of Ha, temperature and pressure) IE- Index Error (= or minus Index Error of sextant) PA- Parallax in Altitude (function of HP and Ha) SD- Semi-Diameter. One half of the angular width of the Sun or Moon. HP- Horizontal Parallax Hs- Sextant Altitude- the initial, uncorrected, sextant measurement from the horizon to a celestial body. Also known as Height of sextant. Ha- Apparent Altitude= Hs minus Dipor minus IC (Index Correction) Also known as Apparent Height. Ho- Observed Altitude- final corrected sextant angular measurement. Also known as Height observed. Hc- Computed Altitude. Also known as Height computed. Int- Intercept (=Ho or minus Hc) Always subtract the smaller figure from the larger. Z- Azimuth. Horizontal angle in degrees between True North and the celestial body. by Ming-Cheng Tsou, Ph.D., National Kaohsiung Marine University, Taiwan POLISH MARITIME RESEARCH 3(75) 2012 Vol 19; pp. 53-59 10.2478/v10012-012-0031-5 Generic Algorithm for Solving Celestial Navigation Fix Problems (pdf 436kb) ABSTRACT In this work, we employ a genetic algorithm, from the field of artificial intelligence, due to its superior search ability that mimics the natural process of biological evolution.

It is found that the proposed approach, the Simultaneous Equal-altitude Equation Method (SEEM), can directly calculate the Astronomical Vessel Position (AVP) without an additional graphical procedure. The SEEM is not only simpler than the matrix method but is also more straightforward than the Spherical Triangle Method (STM). Due to tedious computation procedures existing in the commonly used methods for determining the AVP, a set of optimal computation procedures for the STM is also suggested. In addition, aimed at drawbacks of the intercept method, an improved approach with a new computation procedure is also presented to plot the celestial line of position without the intercept. The improved approach with iteration scheme is used to solve the AVP and validate the SEEM successfully. Methods of solving AVP problems are also discussed in detail. Finally, a benchmark example is included to demonstrate these proposed methods. by Stanley W. Gery Neptune Power Squadron, Huntington, New York, Received April 1996, Revised December 1996 Direct Fix of Latitude and Longitude from Two Observed Altitudes (pdf 1mb) ABSTRACT This work presents a direct method for obtaining the latitude and longitude of an observer from the observed altitudes of two celestial bodies. No assumed position or dead-reckoned position or plotting is required. Starting with the Greenwich hour angles, declinations, and observed altitudes of each pair, the latitude and longitude of the two points from which the observations must have been made are directly computed. The algorithm is presented in the paper, along with its derivation. Two different, inexpensive, programmable pocket electronic calculators were programmed to execute the algorithm, and they do it in under 30 s. The algorithm was also programmed to run on a personal computer to examine the effect of the precision of the calculations on the error in the results. The findings show that the use of eight decimal places in the trigonometric computations provides acceptable results. by A.

ABSTRACT Although many mathematical approaches to the celestial fix problem have been published, all of them fundamentally assume a stationary observer. Since this situation seldom occurs in practice, methods have been developed that effectively remove the observer’s motion from the problem before a fix is determined. As an alternative, this paper presents a development of celestial navigation that incorporates a moving observer as part of its basic construction. This development allows recovery of the information on the vessel’s course and speed contained in the observations. Thus, it provides the means for determining, from a suitable ensemble of celestial observations, the values of all four parameters describing a vessel’s rhumb-line track across the earth: latitude and longitude at a specified time, course, and speed. In many cases, this technique will result in better fixes than traditional methods.

The earth’s rotation rate is not uniform, its axis of rotation is not fixed in space, and even its shape and relative positions of its surface locations are not fixed. For the purposes of pointing a telescope to one-arcsecond accuracy, we need not worry about shape and surface feature changes, but changes in the orientation of the earth’s rotation axis are very important. ” Discusses small errors in measurements and standards due to perturbations of the earth. 2/28/2017 Coordinate Systems for Direction John Thorstensen, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH 03755 Coordinates, Time and the Sky This subject is fundamental to anyone who looks at the heavens; it is aesthetically and mathematically beautiful, and rich in history… Copyright © 1997-2011 Henning Umland; PDF file can be found on this page on his web site: https://www.celnav.de/page2.htm Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts and no Back-Cover Texts.

Celestial Navigation Example (download 633kb) Problem, solution with Andres program, import GPX into Opencpn. by Andres Ruiz Many thanks to Sean who has advanced the work of others and NAV for his technical review of the plugin and his generous assistance in preparing this documentation.

Also please remove ”.doc“ from “my_astro_sight_2017.txt.doc”. Mer Pass is Meridian passages of the Sun (LL) or The Noon Sight (RYA Astronavigation Chapter 5). All my sights are NOT in the same time so you need to do “running fix”(maybe somebody can improve this plugin to have build in drawing “running fix”). For all 17 sights, I first calculated on paper during passage using Sight Reduction Tables Almanac for 2017 and to compere it, I do it again using Long Term Almanac 2000-2050 - Kolbe (which isgreat). Lastly I put my sight into plugin to check it and it looks OK. Same as my paper work (except Mer Pass). What I would like to see as an option to this plugin is Meridian passage of the Sun. I used those sight as Sun LL in the plugin but it is NOT as precise as could be (Astro17 - I have on the paper 18°10’N [on GPS it was 18°10,6’N] - plugin draw circle in 18°12.9’N - the reason is that time of the Mer Pass of the Sun is very difficult to measure precisely). A Simplified Example The menu selection Sight Highlighted > Edit > Sight > FIND is used to help find the Altitude, Azimuth or the celestial bodies, and currently does not calculate any of the Parameter corrections. Indeed, these calculations would have to be the mathmatical reverse of those found in the file sightdialog.cpp (Lines 151-159) and would have to be done in reverse order. The reason this is important, is if you use this armchair method, the circles of position will not be exact, so your fix will not be as accurate as if you actually take a sight. We are going to use the all the same times and locations for the sights. Everything that can be set the same will be. Clock Offset =0 Time: Boston Time (UTC-5): Oct 10, 2017, 13:00 so UTC 10/10/17 18:00 DR Shift: Distance=0 Bearing=0 Parameters: Eye height=2.0 m Temp 10 c, Pressure=1010, Index Error 0 min Latitude: 42.35, Longitude to -71.1 Enter these stars and values Using “Find” and Altitude set for the Star and enter the Lat/Long above: Star - Altitude Entered Alkaid 79.501993 Kochab 58.133196 Arcturus 66.507224 Sun 36.888867 I suppose I should go up to the rooftop to use my sextant and learn how to take sights again. But that is not the purpose here. We want to check Celestial_Navigation_pi. So this an armchair method that I think may be ok using the “Find” Button. (Short Answer: I think the problem was the default setting of “Clock Offset: -10000 seconds”! This should be set at default=0 IMHO) Here is a sample test sight.xml.doc file that you can use if you would like. Remove the ”.doc“ please.

Normally use the (+) and (-) buttons or the mouse scroll-wheel for zooming in and out, but maybe you prefer to use a slider. The position of the slider (far left, far right or somewhere in between) gives you a direct indication of the zoom-status. Install and Enable the plugin: Instructions Once the plugin is installed and enabled Click “OK” in the Chart Scale Preferences window and then “OK” in the Plugins-window. Now the Chart Scale slider should appear on your screen. In this example the slider-button is to the far left. That means “zoom in as far as possible”. And in this example the slider-button is to the far right. That means “zoom out as far as possible”. What are basic (standard) actions you have to do to make ChartScale-pi work. Well, that is quite simple. Click on the slider-bar. Click left of the slider-button to zoom in… And click right of the slider-button to zoom out.

Intended to aid in planning longer sailing voyages, to help visualize weather patterns, and to integrate with weather routing plugin to compute optimal sailing routes. Weather_routing plugin will use Climatology to make long voyaging routes. This plugin goes well beyond what a Pilot chart provides. Manage and view monthly gridded Climate data compiled from various sources. Satellite weather data from the last 30 years is averaged, then represented using only useful bits, then compressed to produce a much smaller database used by the plugin. Climatology provides monthly data for Wind, Currents, Sea Level Pressure, Sea Temperature, Air Temperature, Cloud Cover, Precipitation, Relative Humidity, Lightning, Sea Depth, and Cyclones. July Wind with Current overlay. (Click for enlarged view) See FAQ below. The wind atlas time shows the percentage of time the wind is in each of eight directions as a length of the arrow or in the case it is over 29% of the time a number is shown. The barbs indicate wind speed, each barb being 5 knots. The numbers inside the circle, if blue give the percentage of average speed as calm (3 knots or less) or in red at least gale force (above 34 knots and above). Weather_routing_pi can utilize the 30 year wind averages and current date from Climatology_pi. This is a unique and useful application. For more information see Weather_routing_pi. Climatology Data Types with Display Options Climatology has a number of Data Types. The display characteristics of each data type are controlled from the “Config” menu which first requires selection of the particular data type from a dropbox. Amoungst the display controls for each datatype are Enable/Disable, and to show the data as a “Overlay” which requires that OpenGL be enabled under Option > Display > Advanced. The display options have been configured already for general use provided OpenGL is checked and should require no special configuration effort to be useful, however as users become familiar with the plugin, they may wish to change a setting for their type of use (such as if they do not have OpenGL checked.) The table below shows four data types that are normally shown in vector format and do not require that Overlay be checked, the other data types can also be configured to not require that Overlay be checked if OpenGL is not operational. Click for an englarged view. Normal Vector Data Types (Opengl not required) - Malaysia Wind - December Current - December Pressure - December Cyclones - December The table below shows data types which are normally shown with Overlay checked and OpenGL turned on, however they can be configured to show vector data when Opengl is off, by unchecking “Overlay” for each data type and configuring a few of the display settings. Click for enlarged view. Normal Overlay Data Types (requires Opengl) - Atlantic Pressure Sea Temperature - July Cloud Cover Precipitation Relative Humidity Sea Depth Note: The Data-Types in the table above can be configured by the user to show data if Opengl is not turned on by selecting “Config”, selecting the appropriate data type from the Drop Down window, and unchecking “Overlay” and then selecting “Numbers”.

Windows: Download and run installer Linux: dpkg -i .deb or rpm -i .rpm or cd /usr; sudo tar xavf You must also get the data files, the plugin will inform you where to install them. How do I set the Wind Rose settings so that they work right? Set the two settings somewhere around Size:100 and Spacing:100 or Size:125 and Spacing:60. Wind set at Size:100 and Spacing:100 Wind set at Size:125 and Spacing:60 (Size:140 and Spacing:100 also might work) Also Enable in the Wind Tab. CL-DATA separated by type is located in Sourceforge Weather_routing is only as good as the data provided by the Grib plugin, the Climatology plugin, and your Boat Polars. Note: The plugin has been modified to automatically download these files. Climatology plugin: Previously depended on a separate set of files that must be downloaded, extracted and placed in the proper directory. Climatology data is generally averaged since the 1980’s depending on data type and sources available (for example, Wind data is averaged 6 hr data since 1987). The entire source data set is over 180 gb, however after averaging and compression it becomes about 7mb. There are various macro factors which affect weather over a given season which should be considered, including El Nino, Gulf stream, etc. Climatology has averaged these effects. These planning tools may be helpful, but should be taken with a healthy “grain of salt” as any good sailor (who looks out to the horizon) should know. -Rick Gleason The Climatology Plugin was written by Sean Depagnier who has written many Opencpn plugins. There is a strong likelihood you have already used one of his plugins. The plugin is over 1000 lines of code written with care and skill.

However, including coefficients appears to be a good idea, as you have already done.) Provide Compass Course (CC) calculated from True-Variation-Magnetic-Deviation-Compass (TVMDC) values. Provide for entry of a Deviation Table. Since OpenCPN 'knows' True and Variation (from WMM plugin), with Deviation we can have the Compass course to steer. Possibly integrate some of the functionality into OpenCPN core with WMM_pi. While working on a new Compass Deviation plugin, What there is now: Possible to use multiple compasses on multiple ships Make your one Deviation Table by taking Compass Bearings. (Als sun’s azimuth possible) TO DO but on my list is re-sending a nmea headg (HDG) sentence including True North Course. Production of a Table of Coefficient Show additional curves for each bearing with an offset of +-1 degree error Print the Deviation Table. For Dead Reckoning Mode (no GPS available) a Compass Course (CC) is needed in OpenCPN. Possible separation of developing a deviation table(s) plugin from automating the creation of deviation tables (swinging a compass). A plugin that provides a compass course from known deviation tables would be immediately useful and it simplifies the development process and will become available sooner perhaps. A cellphone does have a fluxgate sensor just as most electronic compasses on board. And most fluxgate sensors are nowadays 3D that means they are actually three sensors (for x,y and z directions). A fluxgate is a way to measure magnetic field strength. For a compass we can forget about the z direction. If we have a compass on board our ship, the reading is likely to be influenced by the ships own magnetic field. Think of this ships magnetic field as being a magnetic of some strength and in some direction. What an electronic compass does if the auto compensate feature is 'on', while steaming in a circle, measure the strength of the magnetic field. The field that is measured is the combination of earth and ships field. It is clear that if ships field and earth field are working in the same direction, the resulting total field will be high. Also if working in opposite direction the result will be low. Then the Compass computer starts calculating and makes an internal Correction Table based on the high and low course and a sinewave like correction between them. From then on it takes the compass readings, adds the Correction and outputs the Corrected Compass Course. This works rather well for a lot of circumstances. But it could be that the ships magnetic field is equal or even stronger then the earth field. Then it is not possible to calulate a correction table. (your compass will warn you to find another place for the sensor). And especially on steel ships there is something like 'induced magnetic'. This is if the earth magnetic field 'sea’s' a iron bar then, as the iron bar is a better magnetic conductor then air, the earth field will run trough the bar. Unfortunately we have now a bar with on one side magnetic field 'lines' going in and the other side coming out. ** that IS a magnet. Only a magnet not constant and even changing N/S poles on different courses. Self Compensating Fluxgate compasses can’t correct for these induced fields. Then there is still the Z direction. As long the vessel is upright this won’t do anything to the compass reading. If sailing however it will cause a heeling error. And again an auto compensate can’t fix this. If you 'Compensate' (with magnets) a compass, or only make a 'Deviation Table', you need the true ships course (some way or another) and compare this with the compass reading. The modern way is bring your own GPS compass, but a gyro will also do. Most of us won’t have either of them, so we need something else. A very good and accurate one is the sun (if you have a correct time). A good compass will have a shadow pin to make it easy to take a sun bearing. But a thin line with a small weight could also throw a nice shadow line over the compass rose. A leading line (lights) is also a good true course if you steam right into it. What I often use is OpenCPN. Make a route to a point some distance away. Make a heading straight to that point and compare the compass course with the true course. In my Plugin (in progress) all three could be used and the PI will take care of the calculation and drawing of the deviation table. Dirk Thanks for the specs. We are more or less on one line. As a point from your doc it will make it easier to add from an existing deviation table. About your remarks about curve fitting and sine wave, the deviation is always a result of the formula Dev=A + B.sin(CC) + C.cos(CC) + D.sin(2.CC) + E.cos(2.CC). Where CC is Compass Course and A to E constant values. I do curve fitting following above formula and calculate the A..E values. In the preview the Curve including original points are visible, so you can see how accurate your input is/was. Having the compass course in the route steering popup window is in the core code, and can’t be changed from the plugin. But maybe in the future it is possible to merge with the variation plugin. Then it would be a standard addon for OpenCPN and the core code setting for magnetic-readings could be changed in compass-readings. First Menu, Enter Ship and Compass Name Enter Compass Bearing and True Bearing Calculation of Deviation Table and Graph What does the pi do B. Why can the pi be useful Where to get the pi B. How to install the pi What are basic (standard) actions you have to do to make the pi work Example: “how to set up a Watchdog Alarm”. What options are there after performing the standard actions Examples: 1. Choice for a specific type of Watchdog Alarm (anchor, boundary, speed, course, deadman, NMEA etc.) 2. Choice for a specific type of alarm-signal (pop-up message, sound, command) 3. Setting various parameters (range in meters, degrees, time in seconds or minutes, speed etc.) Will this plugin help determine the deviation, or is it just for making the corrections? Will the compass indications include deviation with the assumption we are using a magnetic compass rather than a GPS compass?:: * The plan is both. For a regular compass it will help to make a deviation table on paper. (in theory taking as less as 5 bearings should be enough) And for an electronic (nmea) compass it can, in cooperation with the variation PI, correct the magnetic course up to a true course. * Mind you, an electronic compass with auto compensation doesn’t mean that the deviation is zero. It has, just as an ordinary compass has, a remaining deviation after compensation. * Need to be a little careful here or one could get a false sense of accuracy. Only 5 compass errors will not allow a deviation table to be made. We need the vessel to be heading on all the cardinal points, North, South, East and West. And also the inter-cardinals, NE, SE, SW, NW, as a minimum, taking the deviation on each heading. Recording the deviation on courses within about 5 degrees of each of those headings will not affect the result too much. So perhaps build up the information but not allow the table to be made until the minimum number of readings have been taken. * A useful addition could be the production of a Table of Coefficients. If you see an 'A' coefficient this would indicate a lubber line not aligned with the fore and aft line of the boat. * Agreed, 5 is the theoretic mathematical minimum., but for praxis the more the better and at least in every quadrant. I do show the coefficients. (see last picture) I believe it is a good idea to show additional curves for each bearing with an offset of +-1 degree error. That should give a nice idea of the accuracy of the result. Wouldn’t a cellphone be useful to calibrate a compass? Their Compass often requires calibration by twisting in 3 directions?:: * A cellphone will be of no help. Compass deviation is caused by the vessels own magnetism. * By compensating you try to add a few magnets that will be just as strong but in opposite direction then the ships magnetism. The ships magnetism influence will be different for each place onboard. This means if you have a movable compass you cant compensate it. What I try to do is allow to take bearings to a known point (is known bearing), and so find the misreading of the compass. The misreading is deviation + variation * For a known bearing you could choose from a leading line(lights), a fixed point or a bearing of the sun. * George Winthur our compass adjuster uses an electric gyroscope to adjust our Ritche magnetic compass by comparisons. He got it close enough to call it zero deviation but we’ve removed an alu housing for old radar around the pedestal so it must be checked. * Furthermore, while deviation can be reduced by 'correction' as Rooiedirk describes, it cannot be completed eliminated. Maybe it can be -0- on one or a few headings, but there will be some residual deviation on other headings. Thus a deviation table for each compass that is used for navigation or piloting is required. Being careful with stowage can help reduce deviation and random changes in deviation, e.g. don’t stow tinned foods near the fluxgate compass.

The DR plugin is a means of adding DR positions to a route. Because the plugin cannot access 'Route Manager' directly it works by editing a gpx file, which has been exported from 'Route Manager'. DR speed and the time between the DR positions can be changed before the DR gpx is finally created. This plugin is a temporary solution to the problem of creating DR positions. The Draw plugin now allows the creation of DR positions for course legs. Copy 'DR_pi.dll' to the plugins folder. Start OpenCPN. Tools/Options and select 'Enable' for the DR entry. Save the route which you want to add DR positions to by using 'Route Manager'. Make a note of the folder where this original route file can be found. Start DR: The main page of the plugin appears: The DR speed and interval between DR positions have been added. The DR route name is entered in the bottom box. The process of creating the DR route is started by pressing 'Generate GPX'. A file dialog box appears. Select the route GPX file where DR positions will be added. Immediately after selecting this file a new file dialog box appears. After pressing 'Save' the route_dr gpx file is created in the folder you have chosen. If the original file is not needed you can use the same file name and the original file will be over-written. The plugin can now be closed. Using 'Route Manager' import the DR gpx: The DR route is now available. To avoid confusion the original route can be hidden by using the 'Eye' symbol.","title":"Dead Reckoning","component":"dead_reckoning","version":"","name":"index","url":"/dead_reckoning/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Installation","hash":"_installation","id":1},{"text":"Links","hash":"_links","id":2},{"text":"Definition","hash":"_definition","id":3},{"text":"1.

In addition to driving a simulated vessel across the chart of OpenCPN the vessel can be displayed on Google Earth. The plugin controls the GE camera position. The autopilot can be used. A sample GPX is included. This is a route through the new locks at the southern end of the Panama Canal. The default model to drive is a panamax container ship. Links EarthExplorer_pi source OpenCPN forum plugin EarthExplorer_pi The plugin can be installed by updating the OpenCPN master catalog and using the EarthExplorer_pi entry. Extra requirements The Google Chrome Web Server extension is used to serve the KML files used by GE. Chrome is cross-platform and can be used on MacOSX, Linux and Windows. Install Google Chrome (if not already installed) Start Chrome Dowload the webserver extension from here. Add the extension to Chrome. Start the EarthExplorer plugin. Right-Click on the chart and you will find a menu option EarthExplorer Start Position. After selecting this press Start and test driving the ship and using the controls. On first starting to drive with EarthExplorer the files to link with GE are copied to the GetpPrivateApplicationDataLocation() directory. On Windows this will be similar to C:\\ProgramData\\opencpn\\plugins\\EarthExplorer_pi. On Linux it will be like home/.opencpn/plugins/EarthExplorer_pi/data. If not already installed download and install Google Earth Pro: https://www.google.com/earth/download/gep/agree.html Not sure if the version available from Paul Higgins is compatible. Start the Chrome Web Server After this the Chrome Browser can be shut down. It does not have to be the default browser The webserver displays with a button to choose the default folder. Select the GetpPrivateApplicationDataLocation() directory mentioned above. Testing the plugin will have created a placemark.kml file in the GetpPrivateApplicationDataLocation() directory along with the model file container.dae. Another file is also copied there … link.kml. This provides the network link with GE. Make the OpenCPN connection Select Options→Connections in OpenCPN. Add Connection. Use TCP Network Address 127.0.0.1 and port 8887. File→Open and select `placemark.kml' from the same folder as you set up in the Chrome webserver. * GE should fly to the location of your vessel. You should see the model in the centre of the GE display. * A place called model will have been added to GE Temporary Places. File→Open and select link.kml. This will add a place Earth Explorer to Temporary Places. One of the contents of this place is model. Note Using File→Open may cause Google Earth to freeze. If this happens you may need to open the files by using Windows Explorer. Navigate to the ProgramData/opencpn/plugins/EarthExplorer_pi directory and open the file with GE. If there have been problems you may be asked to use the GE repair tool. Select Clear disk cache: After adding placemark.kml you should see the ship on the GE screen. And after adding link.kml: Start driving the vessel in OpenCPN. You should see the model moving across the screen. If you can still see the model that was dropped when you opened placemark.kml you can de-select and delete that place, as it is no longer needed. Select the `3D Buildings' layer in GE if you want to see models. For instance these include the bridges at the southern end of the Panama Canal. Press the plugin Camera if you want to zoom in or pan/tilt the display in GE. Using OpenCPN Options→Ship the `Ship icon type' can be changed to `real scale vector'. A panamax container ship has length 292m, beam 30m. GPS is approx 270m from the bow and midships. Important. Do not save the temporary places when you close GE. You need to repeat the startup procedure listed above when you open GE again. Many bugs remain. Pleae PM me if you see anything that needs fixing.

The keyword for this GPS Odometer is simplicity. Note that, as this is a GPS/GNSS based instrument, it requires GPS/GNSS data to display any data at all. The MNEA 0183 sentences RMC and GGA or the PGN’s 129026 and PGN 129029 for Signal K or NMEA2000 is a must. See further information below. The GPS Odometer contain these basic functions: An optional Speedometer with both analog and digital readout. A Total Distance log, always displayed. A Trip Distance log, always displayed. A checkbox for Automatic trip reset to automatically execute Trip reset as defined in the setup dialogue. An optional Departure / Arrival time display with digital readout. A Trip reset button that resets Trip, Departure Time and Arrival Time. An optional Autoreset Trip checkbox allowing to automatically execute Trip reset as defined in the setup dialogue. A log generator logging up to one month old trip log information in text, csv or html format. The instruments are shown in a predefined order and it is not possible to change that order. It is however possible to toggle the optional instruments on or off right-clicking on the instrument panel selecting 'Settings'. Note that the panel size is always set to default size when an instrument is added or removed, you may then manually adjust the panel size or location to fit your preferences. The trip log, with viewing options, is selected right-clicking on the instrument panel selecting 'View trip log'. Total distance, Trip distance. Trip reset button and the Automatic trip reset checkbox are always displayed and can not be toggled off. Just leave the GPS Odometer on screen and reset the trip counter once the trip is ended (and log book written?) or before the next trip starts, alternatively use the automatic trip reset option. The trip will be considered started as soon as the speed increases above 'Minimum Route Speed', preset at 2 knots (selectable in the settings menu). The departure date and the departure time will be displayed on the instrument as the upper value for 'Departure & Arrival'. The trip will be considered stopped as soon as the speed decreases below 'Minimum Route Speed' and the arrival date and time will be displayed on the instrument as the lower value for 'Departure & Arrival'. If the speed then again increases above 'Minimum Route Speed' the trip be either continued or a new trip started (new departure) depending on if the 'Trip reset' button has been clicked or not. You may even shut down OpenCPN for e.g. a lunch break, the 'Trip distance' as well as 'Departure & Arrival' times are remembered until the Trip reset button is clicked or an Automatic trip reset is executed. The Automatic trip reset will be executed if 'Autoreset Trip' is selected and the stop time exceeds the 'Minimum trip stop time' set in the settings menu. Departure and arrival times are displayed according to the ISO standard 8601 primary alternative ('YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). 'Total distance' is simply a counter of distance travelled and is not affected by the reset button. You can edit (increase only) the 'Totaldistance' value in the OpenCPN configuration file e.g. if the GPS Odometer is replacing another log instrument. The format is '12345.6' (one decimal only) and remember to do that while OpenCPN is shut down or your change will be lost. The Leg Trip functionality is a bit different as it has higher time and distance resolution, intended for e.g. tight navigation time and distance measurements like “How far is it between X and Y?” or “How long time does it take between Y and Z?”. Start or resume the distance and time counters clicking the Start/Stop Leg button, it will count distance and time until the button is clicked again. Click the Leg Reset button to zero distance and time and begin a new count session. This counter does not use the 'Minimum Route Speed' setting nor is it saved during trip stops. Several parameters can be adjusted in the 'Settings' menu, just right-click somewhere on the instrument and select 'Settings'. The most important setting is the selection of source protocol between NMEA 0183 (default), Signal K or NMEA2000. This selection is used to avoid the same type of information coming from multiple sources but still allowing e.g. NMEA 0183 to be generated from Signal K without affecting the GPS Odometer. This is a common situation when e.g. using a NMEA 2000 GPS/GNSS unit and a VHF with NMEA 0183 input. The trip log will detect Departure (trip start), Arrival with trip distance and Resumed trip where a trip is restarted without an intermediate trip reset, manual or automatic. You may also, in the settings menu, select the shortest trip stop to be detected and logged, either all stops or stops longer than the time selected in the setings menu. To view the log, just right-click somewhere on the instrument and select 'View trip log'. This opens a menu where the viewing options are selected. Note that there must be an associated viewer available for the 'External viewer' alternative. The generated view file is located either in the users home directory (Linux) or the Documents directory (Windows). The saved files have the extension .txt, .csv or .html respectively. File type .csv will have to be converted if used in e.g Excel but there are also free csv file readers available. Please note that trip log information older than one month is automatically removed. The text style and size settings are: 'Title': Title rows and button texts 'Data': Distance and time data 'Description: Digital speed notation in speedometer 'Small': Speedometer numbering When changing text styles or sizes, the instrument area is not updated to accomodate the new style or size but you need to manually adjust to the new outlook. Please do not set 'Min Route Speed' to low or you may get false trip start/stop times due to e.g. position inaccurancies when anchored. The Odometer has a filtering that dashboard does not use, e.g. it requires a certain number of satellites (default 4) and a HDOP level of 4 (not required by dashboard). These settings can be changed in the OpenCPN configuration file, see the troubleshooting section below. Please note that HDOP and Satellites are used with SIGNAL K that names these as 'GNSS Fix', 'DGNSS fix' and 'Precise GNSS'. One of these must be present. GPS/GNSS signal information, coming from NMEA 0183, Signal K or NMEA2000 are selected in the settings menu. If one or both of the required sentences, as mentioned above, are missing: There will be no speed or distance count nor will the GPS Odometer start displaying data until NMEA 0183 GGA or NMEA2000 is indicating a valid GPS/GNSS signal (using the 'Satellites in use' and 'HDOP' information). There is also a few seconds delay (default 15) when powered on or when switching protocol, this to allow the system to be properly settled. Many GPS/GNSS units are also somewhat inaccurate until the position is accurate enough. Note that this is a power on delay that has no effect later on. This setting, named PowerOnDelaySecs, may be updated (from 5 and up) in the OpenCPN configuration file. It is essential to use a good quality and stable GPS/GNSS receiver. Some GPS/GNSS units are quite unstable when starting (although they are indicating a valid fix) and, as all distances are added, this will add to the trip and total distances or trigger false departure times. A good and reliable GPS/GNSS unit, properly mounted, is the single most important navigational tool you have onboard. It should be on top of the list. There may also be other GPS/GNSS units, like e.g. AIS or VHF radio with built-in GPS/GNSS receivers, and this may then generate multiple position and speed data. The OpenCPN priority system is message based and may, if a message is e.g. incomplete, cause a mix of messages from to different GPS/GNSS units. Messages are also processed in the order received and the last sentence of each type will be used. The order used is as shown in the NMEA Debug Window (opened via 'Options → Connections' and activating 'Show NMEA Debug Window'). Also note that the protocol (NMEA0183 / Signal K / NMEA2000) is selected in the GPS Odometer settings as all the required signals, or priority options, are currently not available for external plugins like the GPS Odometer. A general recommendation is hence to have one, and only one, reliable good quality GPS/GNSS receiver sending navigational data (e.g. NMEA0183 RMC, GGA, GSV and GSA) to OpenCPN. If you experience any kind of problems when having multiple GPS/GNSS units, then verify by either generating a VDR file for examination (recommended) or by opening the NMEA debug window and and check the sentences, those dropped will display in brown. You may close the settings main window and display only the debug window, this will allow you to stop/resume and copy the content if required. If generating a VDR file, then use a standard text editor and remove everything but the lines starting with 'xxRMC' or 'xxGGA'. The letters 'xx' may be 'GP', 'EC' or something else, see the document referenced below. Group the lines and then glance through them swiftly comparing them, you will easily spot any irregularities. The trick is then to know which unit that is in error. Now test having only one unit sending GPS/GNSS related data, preferably your dedicated GPS/GNSS receiver. All other GPS/GNSS related data should be dropped. You may efficiently do that following this procedure: Go to 'Options → Connections' and select the unit whose sentences should be dropped. In the 'Input filtering' select 'Ignore sentences'. Add the sentences RMC, GGA, GSV and GSA to be dropped. This should not affect the functionality of any units, just make OpenCPN drop GPS/GNSS generated sentences. If this fixes the problem, then you have an error/discrepancy in the sentences received from your 'extra' GPS/GNSS units. A good reference page for NMEA 0183 is found at: https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd/NMEA.html A note on NMEA 2000 GPS/GNSS units: OpenCPN has currently no option to prioritize units within a NMEA 2000 network so multiple GPS/GNSS units in the same NMEA 2000 network pose a large risk of getting conflicting messages unless they can be individually controlled. The most common problem is the GPS/GNSS signal quality, often due to non-optimal GPS/GNSS unit placement. This can be easily verified examining the NMEA 0183 GGA message using OpenCPN 'Options → Connections' and activating 'Show NMEA Debug Window'. If you are using NMEA 2000 you need to generate NMEA 0183 messages either by using the TwoCan plugin or using the signalk-to-nmea0183 app activating GGA messages and reading the NMEA 0183 messages thru port 10110. Look for the GGA messages and these fields: Field 6 (following the E/W) is the Quality indicator, Should be 1 thru 5. Field 7 indicates the number of satellites, should be a minimum of 4. The required number of satellites may be adjusted setting the 'SatsRequired' parameter in the OpenCPN configuration file. The allowed range is 4 and up. Field 8 is the HDOP (Horizontal dilution of precision). This should be as low as possible with a recommended maximum of 4. The HDOP limit may be adjusted setting the 'HDOP' parameter in the OpenCPN configuration file. The allowed range is 1 thru 10. Increasing the 'HDOP' value is a last resort if nothing else helps but also an indication that there is a GPS/GNSS problem, placement or otherwise. If any of these values becomes 'invalid' then the speed indicator will go to '0' and it will take a few seconds before the speedometer is showing any speed. This delay is introduced as the speed may, at start or straight after a valid fix, still show an erroneous value hence affecting the distance calculations. The delay, named 'PowerOnDelaySecs' defaults to 15 but may be adjusted setting the parameter in the OpenCPN configuration file. The allowed range is 5 and up. You should never see this effect apart from when the system is started if all is working as it should. Total distance, Trip distance, Departure time and Arrival time are saved in the OpenCPN configuration file at shutdown. They are also, together with a few other parameters, saved in the GPS Odometer data directory and updated as values changes. The data log file in the GPS Odometer data directory also contains the log information. This dedicated save is done to ensure the information will survive e.g. a power outage or a system crash where OpenCPN does not shut down properly. The information in the data directory overrides the distances and times in the OpenCPN configuration file. . There is one exception for the Total distance where the highest of the two walues is used, see the description for Total distance above. . If a sudden shutdown occurs while on route, no arrival time will be given upon restart as there is no Arrival time available, it will display three dashes instead. . Starting and stopping OpenCPN, or clicking Trip reset, while on speed above 'On Route' speed may confuse the logging facility as e.g. an arrival time may be missing. The text height and length in the dialogue may not be correctly included in the size calculation. Just manually adjust the size to accomodate the texts. Some of the parameters from the Settings menu does not update the instruments until OpenCPN is restarted, like the maximum speed setting in the speedometer. The display on high reolution screens may not be optimal but regular screens should work just fine. The GPS Odometer is installed using the package manager. There is (currently?) no version available for the Android environment as I don’t have either the tools nor the knowledge to do that. Any help from the community would be appreciated. The name is 'GPS Odometer' as I started this before any GNSS units was available for regular boaters and changing the name is never a winning concept. GPS is also frequently used covering both GPS and GNSS systems. I did this plugin as I wanted a simple GPS/GNSS based Odometer. The Logbook has that option but I did not need all the other stuff in there and also wanted an on-screen solution. For 'dry-runs' I recommend using the VDR plugin playing a suitable trip.

Example application Script library Resources Support FAQs To provide a plugin that allows users to write scripts that extend the functioning of OpenCPN without getting into the complexity of writing a plugin. The plugin provides one or more console windows comprising a script pane, a results pane and some buttons. You enter your JavaScript in the script pane (or load it from a file) and click on the Run button. The script is compiled into byte code and executed and any result is displayed. At its simplest, enter, say print(\"Hello from OpenCPN\\n\"); When you click on the Run button, the message will be displayed. (The \\n bit adds a new line to the end of the message.) The plugin extends JavaScript to add many interfaces to OpenCPN and it is here that the fun starts. As an example, the following statement takes the supplied NMEA sentence, adds a checksum (replacing any existing one) and pushes it out over the OpenCPN connections: OCPNpushNMEA(“$OCRMB,A,0.000,L,,Yarmouth,5030.530,N,00120.030,W, 15.386,82.924,0.000,5030.530,S,00120.030,E,V\"); It is also possible to arrrange for a JavaScript function to be executed on certain OpenCPN events. For example, this script listens for an NMEA sentence and, if it the checksum is correct, displays it. OCPNonNMEAsentence(handleNMEA); function handleNMEA(result){ if(result.OK){ print(“Received: “, result.value, “\\n”); } else print(“Bad checksum\\n”); } The following script examines all waypoints. If the icon name is circle, it sets the waypoint to display at all chart scales. Otherwise it set it to display on large scale charts only. Thus anchorage waypoints, docks and the like will not clutter small scale charts. You can easily adopt this to your own criteria. scaled = unscaled = 0; // counters guids = OCPNgetWaypointGUIDs(); // get all waypoint GUIDs for (g = 0; g < guids.length; g++){ // for each waypoint waypoint = OCPNgetSingleWaypoint(guids[g]); // get the waypoint if (!waypoint.isFreeStanding) continue; // skip routepoints if (waypoint.iconName == \"circle\") { waypoint.useMinScale = false; unscaled++;} else { waypoint.minScale = 52000; waypoint.useMinScale = true; scaled++; } OCPNupdateSingleWaypoint(waypoint); // update in OCPN } scriptResult(\"scaled: \" + scaled + \" unscaled: \" + unscaled); There is a library of useful scripts which you can use as they are or modify for your own purposes. Contributions to this are welcome. A comprehensive user guide is available as a .pdf and also in .epub format, which may be more convenient for mobile devices. They can be down-loaded from here: User guide as .pdf User guide as .epub There is also a technical guide for those wanting to undestand the internal functioning of the plugin or maintain it. This is not relevant for plugin users. Cruisers Forum Thread Github Repository For discussion on applications of the plugin, use the forum thread. For problems with the plugin or feature requests, please raise an issue here. How do I learn JavaScript programming? Start with a simple example and build up by trying things. Have a look at the examples in the script library. There is a good reference guide here. JavaScript is much used in programming web sites and many of the examples in the tutorials assume that. Ignore examples accessing the document object, such as document.getElementById(\"demo\").innerHTML The reference material is very good but some of the latest JavaScript constructs are not supported by the plugin. See the plugin user guide. Can it do this or that? Read the user guide which documents the APIs that allow a script to interact with OpenCPN. Have a look at the library of sample scripts, which may help you see how to do what you want. If you cannot find what you need, ask in the plugin forum. It cannot do what I need - can that be added? If you have confirmed the plugin cannot do something you would like it to, submit an enhancement request here.","title":"Javascript Plugin","component":"javascript","version":"","name":"index","url":"/javascript/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Aim","hash":"_aim","id":1},{"text":"How does it work?","hash":"_how_does_it_work","id":2},{"text":"Example application","hash":"_example_application","id":3},{"text":"Script library","hash":"_script_library","id":4},{"text":"Resources","hash":"_resources","id":5},{"text":"Support","hash":"_support","id":6},{"text":"FAQs","hash":"_faqs","id":7}]},"169":{"id":169,"text":"Launch external programs from within Opencpn. Source: https://github.com/nohal/launcher_pi Download: https://opencpn.org/OpenCPN/plugins/launcher.html Forum: CF Launcher_pI Thread This document is about Launcher plugin (Launcher) A. What does Launcher do The plugin allows the user to define several buttons to launch external (Standard Actions) or internal commands (Keyboard Events). It is primarily targetting touchscreen devices but can also be used with a mouse. External commands are all the commands you can give to your computer. Internal commands are used in OpenCPN itself. B. Why can Launcher be useful You can use a button in Launcher (while you keep running OpenCPN) to do something else with your computer than just running OpenCPN. You could for instance: Open a document with information you find usefull. That can be anything. The manual of your ship’s engine, your favourite recipes for that freshly caught mackerel (or, if you did not catch anything, the book “Fishing for Dummies”), a document with all the facts of interests of the ports you pass, pilotage information, you name it. When you have access to the Internet you could use Launcher to open a specific website. For instance the OpenCPN-website, the Cruisers Forum, Marine-Traffic (AIS) etc. etc. In “Standard actions” we will show some examples. A. Where to get Launcher + *Note*: In this section the instructions are specifically for Launcher, but there is a dedicated page in the manual with information about Downloading, Installing and Enabling Plugins in general. That dedicated page can be found here: link:../install_and_enable.html[Plugins - Install and Enable]. Launcher can be downloaded from http://www.opencpn.org/index.html Click “Downloads” Click “Plugins for OpenCPN 4.2 & 4.4” Scroll down to the “Other”-section and click “Launcher“ B. How to install the plug-in Make sure you choose the file that is compatible with your computersystem. In this manual we presume it’s Windows, so we choose the Windows setup-package. Download the file (double-click). B. How to install Launcher We assume you know where to find the files you download from the Internet (if you don’t: quit now and read the manual of your computer before doing anything else with it) Double-click the downloaded file (with “launcher_pi” in the name and ”.exe” as extension) and follow the set-up instructions. That’s it. But before you can actually use Launcher, you first have to enable that plug-in in OpenCPN. Open (or restart) OpenCPN. Click Tools-Options-. and then Plugins Scroll down untill you see the Launcher-pi. Click “Enable”. Note: If you do not see launcher in the list of plugins, check it was installed in the correct plugings directory of OpenCPN (eg: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\OpenCPN\\plugins) Now the Launcher icon (it looks like an old fashioned ship’s wheel) should appear somewhere in your OpenCPN Toolbar. Follow the steps below to launch an external program Click “Tools” - “Options” - “Plugins” as described before. Scroll down to “Launcher” and click “Preferences”. Clicking “Preferences” will open the menu “Launcher Settings”. In the menu “Launcher Settings”, Click “Add”. Clicking “Add” will open the menu “Launcher Item”. In this menu “Launcher Item” you will have to give Launcher some information. You want a button in Launcher-pi to launch a program for you, so you will have to tell Launcher-pi: 1. What label you want on that button and 2. Where Launcher-pi can find the command to launch that specific program. EXAMPLE: you want a button to launch a specific document (let us assume it is a user manual of your ship) that is made with the program Microsoft WORD. You can find the path and file-name to run WORD by a right-hand mouse-click on the icon (shortcut) for that program. Choose “Properties” and copy the text that is in the field “target”. Let us assume that: The path and file to execute that program is “C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office 15\\root\\office15\\WINWORD.EXE”. The file (document) you want to open is called “Manual_of_my_ship.docx” and stored in a directory C:\\MyShip\\Manuals. IMPORTANT: If the pathname\\filename consist of several words separated with a blank space, change that by removing those blank spaces or by replacing them by underscores. Example: “C:\\My ship\\Manuals” should be renamed to “C:\\Myship\\Manuals” or “C:\\My_ship\\Manuals” and “Manual of my ship.docx” should be renamed to “Manual_of_my_ship.docx”. So to assign a button in Launcher to launch that specific WORD-document, you will have to feed Launcher the following information: 1. The label you want for the button. In this case: “Manual of my ship”. 2. The path and program-file . In this case: “C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office 15\\root\\office15\\WINWORD.EXE”. 3. The path and specific file to open with that program. In this case: “C:\\MyShip\\Manuals\\Manual_of_my_ship.docx”. This is how you do that: Insert the label Manual of my ship Insert the command C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office 15\\root\\office15\\WINWORD.EXE IMPORTANT: Leave one space after “exe” and add the path and name of the file you want to open. In this case: C:\\MyShip\\Manuals\\Manual_of_my_ship.docx The text in the field “command” should read C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office 15\\root\\office15\\WINWORD.EXE C:\\MyShip\\Manuals\\Manual_of_my_ship.docx Click “OK” to save the Launcher item. Click “OK” to save the Launcher settings. Click “OK” to exit the “options”-menu and return to the main screen of OpenCPN. Now you can execute the command via Launcher-pi. To execute the command via Launcher in OpenCPN, do this: Click on the Launcher icon in the toolbar. Click the button with the label “Manual of my ship” The WORD-document should open. Note: of course this WORD-document can only be opened if you actually have the program WORD on your computer in the given directory (C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office 15\\root\\office15\\WINWORD.EXE) and if you actually do have a document called “Manual_of_my_ship.docx” in the given directory (C:\\MyShip\\Manuals\\). You can repeat this process of adding Launcher items. With every new assignment you will see the number of buttons growing. Launcher can be used to issue OpenCPN a command such as change the scale for a chart (F7 or F8 key). To do this you use a keyboard event in the place of the command. Launcher 1.1 has some nice new functionality Readme in github main repository See Keyboard Events You can use several variables in your commands which will be replaced with the actual values at the moment of command invocation. Variable Meaning ——– ——- %BOAT_LAT% Boat Latitude %BOAT_LON% Boat longitude %BOAT_SOG% Boat SOG %BOAT_COG% Boat COG %BOAT_VAR% Magnetic variation %BOAT_FIXTIME% The timestamp of the past fix (seconds since 01/01/1970 UTC) %BOAT_NSATS% Number of satelites “visible” during the last fix Start the command definition with string KBD: followed by coma separated list of key events to send to the main application. A component starting with ! (explanation mark) represents a key down even, a component without the beginning ! represents a key up event. Example: KBD:!S,S represents a short press of the S key, resulting in turning on/off the soundings. Special keys may be used if implemented by the plugin. Example: KBD:!F5,F5 represents a short press of the F5 key, resulting in switching the color scheme. Special keys implemented: F1-F12 Example: KBD:!F7,F7 for a change of chart scale Here are some examples for use of the Launcher Plugin: Launcher can be used to start various nmea VDR files to test plugins. See NMEA-Software towards bottom VDRplayer as Nmea Server + In this example we show how to make a Launcher item to launch a website (in this case the website of the Dutch Coastguard, which is https://www.kustwacht.nl[www.kustwacht.nl]) with Google Chrome. + To do so, you first have to find and copy the command to launch the program Google Chrome. That should be something like C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe. You can find the path and file-name to run Chrome by a right-hand mouse-click on the icon (shortcut) for that program, choose “Properties” and select (all) the text in the field “Target”. Click “copy”. Go to OpenCPN. Edit Launcher. Click Tools-Plugins-Launcher-Preferences Click Add Insert the label (Dutch Coastguard) Insert (paste) the command C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe leave one space after “exe” and add the adress of the website (in this case: www.kustwacht.nl) The text in the field “command”should read: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe www.kustwacht.nl Click “OK” to save the Launcher item. Click “OK” to save the Launcher settings. Click “OK” to exit the “options”-menu and return to the main screen of OpenCPN. Execute the command via Launcher-pi in OpenCPN as described before. Click on the Launcher-pi icon in the toolbar. Click the button with the label “Dutch Coastguard” to open the website. When you are sailing in US waters you might want to consult one of the “United States Coast Pilots”. These pilots are published by the NOAA and can be downloaded (free of charge) from https://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/nsd/cpdownload.htm There are several volumes. In this example we have downloaded “US Coast Pilot nr. 2 (Atlantic Coast: Cape Cod, MA to Sandy Hook, NJ), 207 (46th) Edition”. It is a PDF-document. So if your computer has a program that can read PDF-files, you can read that document on your computer-screen. And with Launcher, you can launch that document directly from within OpenCPN. You just have to add a button for it in “Launcher”. This is what you do: Download the document and save it on your computer. Let’s say you save the document as “Pilot_2_Cape_Cod_to_Sandy Hook.pdf” in a directory “C:\\Nautical\\US_Coast_Pilots” (remember the importance of avoiding spaces between the words in the path- and filename, use underscores instead!) In OpenCPN, edit Launcher as described before: click “Tools” - “Options” - “Plugins”. Scroll down to “Launcher” (make sure the plugin is “Enabled”) Click “Preferences“ Click “Add“ In the field “Label”: enter the name you want to give to the button. In this case for instance “US Pilot 2-Cape Cod to Sandy Hook”. In the field “Command”: enter the path and filename of the program you use to open PDF-files. If you use Adobe Reader it might be something like this:“C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Adobe\\Reader 11.0\\Reader\\AcroRd32.exe”. If you use an alternative PDF-reader, like the freeware PDFXchange Editor, it might be something like this: “C:\\Program Files\\Tracker Software\\PDF Editor\\PDFXEdit.exe”. Leave a space and enter the path and filename of the document you want that program to open. In this case that would be: “C:\\Nautical\\US_Coast_Pilots\\Pilot_2-Cape_Cod_to_Sandy_Hook.pdf”. Click “OK” to save the Launcher item. Click “OK” to save the Launcher settings. Click “OK” to exit the “options”-menu and return to the main screen of OpenCPN. Execute the command via Launcher-pi in OpenCPN as described before. Click on the Launcher-pi icon in the toolbar. You should see the button that corresponds with the US Coast Pilot nr. 2. Click that button and the file will open. Q: I have edited Launcher to execute a command, but it doesn’t work. What did I do wrong? A: We don’t know. There’s a lot you might have done wrong. But check the correct pathnames\\filenames. If the pathname\\filename consist of several words separated with a blank space, change that by removing those blank spaces or by replacing them by underscores. Example: “C:\\My ship\\Manuals” should be renamed to “C:\\Myship\\Manuals” or “C:\\My_ship\\Manuals”. Q: Can I use Launcher to shut down my computer? A: Yes. It is possible. Here’s an example how to do it in Windows 7 Home Edition 64 bit. Add a new launcher item. Type in the field under “label” the text “Shut down after 10 seconds” Type in the field under “Command” the text shutdown -s -t 10 -c “I quit. You’ve got the helm” This should shut down your computer 10 seconds after launching that item. Of course you can alter the text “I quit. You’ve got the helm” in anything you like. Just don’t forget to put that text between quotation marks (”). Note: Windows 7 Pro 64-bit might not accept the ”-s” parameter from Launcher. Try ”/s“ instead.","title":"","component":"launcher","version":"0.1","name":"index","url":"/launcher/0.1/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Launcher","hash":"_launcher","id":1},{"text":"Links","hash":"_links","id":2},{"text":"What and Why","hash":"_what_and_why","id":3},{"text":"Installation","hash":"_installation","id":4},{"text":"Enabling Launcher in OpenCPN","hash":"_enabling_launcher_in_opencpn","id":5},{"text":"Standard actions","hash":"_standard_actions","id":6},{"text":"Executing a command via Launcher","hash":"_executing_a_command_via_launcher","id":7},{"text":"Internal OpenCPN Actions","hash":"_internal_opencpn_actions","id":8},{"text":"Launcher Variables","hash":"_launcher_variables","id":9},{"text":"Variables","hash":"_variables","id":10},{"text":"Keyboard Events","hash":"_keyboard_events","id":11},{"text":"Examples","hash":"_examples","id":12},{"text":"VDRplayer","hash":"_vdrplayer","id":13},{"text":"Websites","hash":"_websites","id":14},{"text":"One other example you might find useful.","hash":"_one_other_example_you_might_find_useful","id":15},{"text":"Frequently Asked Questions","hash":"_frequently_asked_questions","id":16}]},"170":{"id":170,"text":"Maintenance Source: https://github.com/rgleason/LogBookKonni_pi rgleason Source: Github Repository - Delatbabel Old Source: Github Repository - Peter Tulp used to maintain the plugin Download: Website Download Forum: LogbookKonni CF Thread The Logbook plugin is useful for creating and maintaining many types of logs for your boat.

Examples include calculating true wind speed/angle from apparent wind data and boat speed information, changing units (degrees C to F or vice-versa, knots to km, etc.), or correcting malformed sentences created by some equipment where the sentence would otherwise be ignored by OpenCPN or displayed improperly. Please note that there is no Toolbar Icon. NmeaConverter works from the Preferences button of the plug-in. Options|Plug-ins|NMEAConvertor –> Preferences To use the plugin a basic understanding of NMEA sentences is required. Please see the User Manual (Advanced Features) for details on NMEA sentences and the fields each sentence contains. The basics of an NMEA sentence are: Initial delimiter (usually $, sometimes !) Talker ID (the instrument sending the data, two characters, optional) Sentence name - three characters Data, in fields, comma separated End delimiter - * Checksum Carriage Return+Linefeed Example $GPRMB,field1,field2,…field15* 14 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | $IDRMB,A,x.x,a,c--c,c--c,llll.ll,a,yyyyy.yy,a,x.x,x.x,x.x,A,m*hh The basic format of a conversion command is: NewSentence, Argument for Field 1, Argument for Field 2, ...Argument for field n NewSentence = $IDYYY where ID is a talker ID you would like to use to denote sentences from the converter. The examples in this manual generally use XX as the talker ID for newly created sentences. YYY is the NMEA sentence identifier you would like to send. A simple conversion example - this sample takes the 5th and 6th fields of an MDA sentence and transmits a new MTA sentence: $XXMTA, $WIMDA5, $WIMDA6 Arguments can take the form of constants (numeric or text), values from an incoming NMEA sentence, or calculations using either or both constants and incoming data. In the simplest form an argument is an incoming NMEA sentence and field number - $GPRMC4 will get the fourth value in any RMC sentence received by OpenCPN from talker GP. See the User Manual (Advanced features) to figure out what sentence you want to send, what data fields are required, and how the fields are configured. You must build a complete version of the sentence you want to send, and put the right data/fields from the original source in the right places for the converter to work properly. A number of detailed examples are provided below for reference. When inserting argument fields the wildcard “?” can be used to tell the converter to use data with any content where the “?” appears. The wildcard “??” at the front of an argument will tell the converter to use data from any talker sending the requested sentence (e.g. $??HDG3 will retrieve the third field from any HDG sentence regardless of sender). Be careful when using wildcards and the talker ID, especially when correcting malformed sentences. If you create a conversion that outputs the same sentence as any field used in the input (e.g. $XXHDG, $??HDG3,…..) you will create a loop that will crash the plugin (and OpenCPN). Every time the plugin evaluates it will see its own creation, because of the wildcard it will reevaluate, … Once a conversion is defined you can select whether to send the calculated sentence on a fixed timing (every x seconds) or only when the incoming data is updated. You do not need to add the end delimiter (*) or the checksum in your converter definitions - the converter will calculate the checksum and add the delimiter and checksum automatically. Depending on the data you are manipulating you may want to go into the options setting \"connections\" and tell OpenCPN to ignore the original data. If you are making unit conversions, for instance, and do not ignore the original data you will end up with a display that flashes between the original value and the converted value. Setting the data to ignore will not affect the converter, the data will still be received there, it simply prevents the display of the data in OpenCPN. For Reference from the User Manual (Advanced features - NMEA Sentences Page), sentences that can be displayed in OpenCPN include: DBT - Depth Below Transducer DPT - Depth of Water GGA - Global Positioning System Fix Data GLL - Geographic Position - Latitude/Longitude HDG Heading - Deviation & Variation HDM - Heading - Magnetic HDT - Heading - True MTA - Air Temperature (obsolete) MDA - Meteorological Composite (obsolete) Use XDR transducer instead. MTW - Mean Temperature of Water VLW - Distance Traveled through Water MWD - Wind Direction & Speed MWV - Wind Speed and Angle RMC - Recommended Minimum Navigation Information RSA - Rudder Sensor Angle VHW - Water speed and heading VTG - Track made good and Ground speed VWR - Relative Wind Speed and Angle VWT - True Windspeed and Angle (obsolete) XDR - Transducer Values ZDA -Time & Date - UTC, day, month, year and local time zone AIVDO - Automatic Information System (AIS) position reports from own vessel Install the plugin in accordance with the User Manual. (Install and enable plugins) Then open the Preferences Dialog to set up your conversions. If you see something like above please enlarge the nmeaSendObjectDlg window so it displays the “OK” and “Cancel” buttons. This is a completely useless sentence that is sent every second to OpenCPN. Check also the NMEAdebug window in the picture above, and note that a checksum is added to the sentence. It is easy to change this one into something like: $GPRMC,085437,A,5324.3052,N,00611.5704,E,3.3,68.9,070614,0.3,E,A Just enter this line into the NMEAConverter > Preference > New > Edit box and Save it. No VDR file is needed. That will fake a GPS position into OpenCPN, but still not very useful. The real power of this plugin is that you can change the data of the sent sentence by cherry picking from incoming sentences. The reason I wrote this plugin was I wanted Dashboard to show the air temperature. To get the data, Dashboard needs an $xxMTA sentence, however I had a Airmar PB200 unit that is sending $xxMDA sentences. An example: We have from the windset, MDA- Meteorological (Obsolete) $WIMDA,30.1,I,1.0,B,11.3,C,,,,,,,18.6,T,18.5,M,5.8,N,3.0,M*27 and want: MDA- Air temperature $xxMTA,11.3,C* Note that the data needed is in fields 5 and 6 of the MDA sentence. (11.3 degrees Celsius) Setting the format to $XXMTA, $WIMDA5, $WIMDA6 will give an output sentence: $XXMTA, 11.3, C*26 Where $WIMDA5 is replaced by the 5th field of the $WIMDA sentence. etc. As seen above, the $XXMTA sentence is sent each time a $WIMDA sentence is received and read by Dashboard. For testing use VDR_pi or VDRplayer and run WIMDA+OCMDA.txt from this zip. But what if I was living in the US and preferred the reading to be in degrees Fahrenheit? Just change the format to: $XXMTA, 9/5*$WIMDA5 32, F The value is recalculated and displayed as degrees Fahrenheit. Use the same file for testing use VDR_pi or VDRplayer and run WIMDA+OCMDA.txt from this zip In NMEAconverter create a HDG (compass) sentence from your COG. Possible use when the autopilot is old and does not receive heading (true or magnetic). Note: Since computation of the drift and surface current requires HDG, it is understood that while using Tactics_pi value for Current speed and direction will not be useful. All you will see is the speed difference between SOG and STW, which would force Current to be the vector component normal to the keel. That means the “current” display will always be directly from bow or stern, in other words the component of the current along the centerline of the boat, assuming your STW(speed through water) is calibrated correctly. See CF Tactics_pi Post #22. The NMEA file being run by VDR_pi is vdr2 - copie.xls Tactics_pi and in particular, NMEAconverter_pi is using $XXHDT,$IIVTG1,$IIVTG2 Remember that setting HDT to COG will give you no drift angle at all (except maybe a small portion via the manual heel input), so you will not see any real current I suggest to set a fixed heel angle to 0 (see screenshot above), to avoid side effects with manual heel input at very low speeds and small speed differences between SOG and STW.

In terms of sog vs. stw, as pointed out, in most cases, diff is negligible I believe. One thing about stw is that the sensor cannot capture the movement of a vessel due to tide (as high as 5 knots!). For my purpose, gps is good enough. One needs to be careful with this calculation. There are at least two different syntaxes for the reporting of relative wind angle. The older VWR and VWT sentences for relative and true wind are not recommended for new devices, but there are many older devices and SeaTalk converters that still use them (specifically, my own instruments). The sentences look like this (with II talker ID in this example): $IIVWR,084.0,R,10.4,N,5.4,M,19.3,K $IIVWT,084.0,R,10.4,N,5.4,M,19.3,K 1 084.0 Wind Angle 0 - 180 2 R Right of vessel heading (L = Left) 3 10.4 Wind Speed 4 N Wind Speed units Knots 5 5.4 Wind Speed 6 M Wind Speed units Metres per second 7 19.3 Wind Speed 9 K Wind Speed units Km/Hr Newer devices use the preferred MWV sentence structure that looks like this (with II talker ID in this case): $IIMWV,084.0,R,10.4,N,A $IIMWV,084.0,T,10.4,N,A 1 084.0 Wind Angle 0 - 359 2 R Relative (T = True) 3 10.4 Wind Speed 4 N Wind Speed units Knots (K = KPH, M = MPH) 5 A Status (A= Valid) Note that VWR/VWT and MWV work totally differently: VWR provides wind angles from 0-180 with an additional parameter of L or R, while MWV provides wind angles from 0-359 with no L or R. Converting your obsolete VWR sentence to the more modern MWV sentence would seem to be impossible without a conditional if() statement, which appears to not be supported (since I was unable to get it to work). Here is the sentence that works best for me for converting VWR (relative/apparent wind) to VWT (true wind). Using the wildcard (instead of II, GP, or WI sender IDs) allows testing with others' VWR sentences, including Paul Elliot’s test NMEA files: $XXVWT,90-deg(atan(($??VWR3*cos(rad($??VWR1))-$??RMC7)/$??VWR3*sin(rad($??VWR1)))),$??VWR2,sqrt(sqr($??VWR3*sin(rad($??VWR1)))+sqr($??VWR3*cos(rad($??VWR1))-$??RMC7)),$??VWR4,,,, Note that there is an invisible character at the end of this sentence (after the four commas). In my testing, things don’t work right without it. I recommend that you include it if you copy/paste this formula into the config dialog. It is possible to replace the sender ID (GP or WI) with ?? which means any sender ID will be accepted. Using the wildcard will allow Paul Elliot’s test NMEA file to work with the NMEAconverter formula, using Seatalk - vYacht dialect: $XXMWV,90-deg(atan(($??MWV3*cos(rad($??MWV1))-$GPRMC7)/$??MWV3*sin(rad($??MWV1)))),T,sqrt(sqr($??MWV3*sin (rad($??MWV1)))+sqr($??MWV3*cos(rad($??MWV1))-$GPRMC7)),N,A Edit: In above formula’s 3.14159265 might be replaced by “pi”, and 3.14159265/180 can also be written as “deg”. http://www.navmonpc.com/downloads.html Normalize orientation between 0 and 360 Formula for re-orienting circular values i.e to keep angle between 0 and 359 is: angle Math.ceil( -angle / 360 ) * 360 Generalized formula for shifting angle orientation can be: angle Math.ceil( (-angle+shift) / 360 ) * 360 in which value of shift represent circular shift for e.g I want values in -179 to 180 then it can be represented as: angle Math.ceil( (-angle-179) / 360 ) * 360 What is math.ceil? Java script function. The Math.ceil() function returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a given number. Note: Math.ceil(null) returns integer 0 and does not give a NaN error. NMEAConverter has this comparable function: ceil : the smallest integer greater than or equal to x Homebrew MOD function: =( Angle /360-INT( Angle /360))*360 All data comes from Raymarine instrument with NMEA 0183. Here the two data values to have in OpenCPN: True Heading True Wind Direction 0-359 $XXHDT,$??HDG1,T $WIMWD,($??MWV1+$??HDT1)+ceil((-($??MWV1+$??HDT1))/360)*360,T,,M,$??MWV3,N,,M Max reports that it works well. - Thank you Max. The formula to normalize the degrees to be between 0-360 is ceil((-($??MWV1+$??HDT1))/360)*360 The BMP180 pressure sensor output from Raspberry Pi/OpenPlotter uses the sentence $OSXDR. This cannot be read by Dashboard. BMP180 Output Units are Bars i.e 1000 times the reading needed for display - mBar/hectoPascal. Any error in the output cannot be corrected. This formula creates an $xxMDA (deprecated) or $xxXDR sentence that can be used by Dashboard. $MYXDR,P, 0.018 1/1000 * $OSXDR2,B,Barometer Deprecated: $MYMDA, , ,0.0181/1000*$OSXDR2,,B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,M (0.018 is an error correction and also adjusts the barometer pressure for a sea level reading) Found it necessary to tick the 'block incoming messages with wrong checksum' box when editing the sentence. When editing the sentence; starting a variable with '.' or '$' causes OpenCPN to freeze. Variables are being read by the plugin all the time and these characters are not recognized. Workaround is to type '0.' and then the number. Also 'OSXDR2' and then add the '$' in front, '$OSXDR2'. Ratsea has fixed an incorrect Raymarine ST60 conversion. Dashboard displays incorrect wind speed data when using the ST60 Multi NMEA Output. The data is treated as Km/hr as it has the K unit identifier and is converted to knots/m per sec/Km/hr as per the Dashboard settings, it then incorrect as the data is already in Knots Change the display units in the wind output sentence from ST60 Multi from K (kms/hr) to N (kts) as the Raymarine instrument incorrectly uses the K identifier for Knots and not the N, so that the Dashboard correctly displays the Wind Speed data in the units selected. Using the NMEA converter, apply the conversion to the MWV sentence with a new ID - xx: $xxMWV,$IIMWV1,$IIMWV2,$IIMWV3,N,$IIMWV5 and tick 'Send after update all variable' With the instrument switched on and receiving the actual live data shows in Blue. The NMEA datastream then becomes: $IIHDM,143,M*3A $IIMTW,025.2,C*26 $IIMWV,155,R,009.0,K,A*2E Input $xxMWV,155,R,9.0,N,A*2B Corrected, the input line is also shown on the dashboard, but too quickly to notice $IIVHW,,T,143,M,00.00,N,00.00,K*63 Whilst developing this code, I found that using the formula: $IIMWV,$IIMWV1,$IIMWV2,$IIMWV3,N,$IIMWV5 would also work if the 'Send every (n) seconds' was ticked, but the Dashboard would flash between the two values of Km/sec and knots. If the Send after update all… was ticked, then OpenCPN would freeze in a continuous loop trying to update the newly created NMEA sentence! Now it is possible to use wildcards in the identifiers. So you could make it talkerid independent by using something similar to .....$??XXX3.... and whatever character on the ? position will cause a hit. Even more important, you might use it for special transducers sending the something like $OWXDR,H,....or $OWXDR,C.... sentence. Note that field 1 is part of the identifier. As the comma is the NMEA separator, you can not use it as an identifier string, but by using a wildcard it works. For example ....$OWXDR?H2... or $??XDR?H2.... will work. Cruiser Forum Post Using wildcards is also useful when the data to be matched is in the data payload rather than the header. In the example below, we have engine data coming from the NMEA stream which contains the correct sender transducer ID, however is not the format required by the Engine Dashboard plug-in. Here is the original NMEA sentences: [code] Engine RPM $ERRPM,E,0,2324.00,,A*69 Oil Pressure, Coolant Temp, and Engine Hours $ERXDR,P,4.04,B,ENGOILP0,C,75.25,C,ENGTEMP0,G,2024 .1,,ENGHRS0*01 Battery0 (Starter) Voltage and Shunt Current $ERXDR,U,13.75,V,BATVOLT0,I,0.8,A,BATCURR0*4D Battery1 (House) Voltage $ERXDR,U,13.27,V,BATVOLT1*14 [/code] You can see that the two battery voltages are distinguished using different transducer IDs, BATVOLT0 and BATVOLT1 The following NMEA Converter plug-in code converts to sentences so that the Engine Dashboard can read them. For the sentence that contains multiple data elements, we can us the wildcard “$ERXDR?P2” to match on the particular sentence that has the data we need. To get battery voltage and current, we need to make liberal use of the wildcard to match out to the “I” in order to distinguish from the BATVOLT1 sentence. this gets us the battery0 voltage and the DC shunt current. For battery1, I have not figured out how to convert this because the only character that distinguishes it from battery0 is the “1” at the end. [code] RPM $IIXDR,T,$ERRPM3,R,MAIN ENGINE OIL PRESSURE $IIXDR,P,$ERXDR?P2*100000,P,MAIN ENGINE COOLANT TEMP $IIXDR,C,$ERXDR?P6,C,MAIN ENGINE HOURS $IIXDR,G,$ERXDR?P10,H,MAIN HOUSE BATTERY VOLTAGE $IIXDR,U,$ERXDR?U??????????????????I2,V,HOUS DC AMPERAGE $IIXDR,U,$ERXDR?U??????????????????I6,A,STRT [/code] See this CF #341 Post and ones preceding. Using convert C to F for temp ( $XXMTA, 9/5*$AIMTW5 32, F) with send after all updates variables checked. As soon as I start to playback a NMEA stream via VDR plugin or VDRplayer.py OpenCPN crashes. A look at the O logs does not produce any clues. As a side note I have compiled and used the Tactics plugin with the same NMEA file with VDRplayer and O and Tactics run just fine. You are using an ..MTW sentence. Format according my info: MTW - Mean Temperature of Water $–MTW,x.x,C_hh This sentence has only 2 fields available, the first one given the temp value and the second just 'C' for 'Celsius'. In your command sentence ($XXMTA, 9/5_$AIMTW5 32, F) ) You are requesting the 5th field of the MTW sentence, but that field does not exist. Try again with $XXMTA, 9/5*$AIMTW1 32, F Used new formula provided above.. Still Crashed. I removed the $Dummy entry that came with NMEAConverter_pi install. OpenCPN no longer crashes with NMEAConverter_pi enabled with a NMEA stream present..and as provided for above $XXMTA, 9/5*$AIMTW1 32, F is showing the “Air Temp” in F in Dashboard on O. “I can never thank the volunteers enough for all these wonderful tools.” Cruiser Forum Post The problem with the incoming sentence: $APHDM, 113,M*0A Which in this case, is a magnetic heading of 113 degrees followed by a bad checksum. Using the NMEA converter sentence, to delete the bad checksum and then add a new checksum after a forced comma, $IIHDM, $APHDM1\", \" Which gets converted to a new sentence of $IIHDM,113, *50 with a new checksum. This assigns the first field of the NMEA sentence from $APHDM (113) to a new virtual source of $IIHDM Tim advises: As you can see, I now have a heading indicator plus dashboard data. The NMEA debug window shows the data coming in and being converted. I’m sure that I should tweak the conversion command to put M in for magnetic, plus tidy up commas and stuff (as per Hakan suggestion), but it is working well, so I am reluctant to “fix” it further just at the moment… Dsanduril reports: “The TMQ checksum includes the '$' delimiter character at the start of the sentence. Per NMEA standard the '$' delimiter at the start of the sentence and the '*' delimiter at the end of the sentence should not be included in the checksum. Checksum should be calculated by XOR of all characters between the delimiters. [Suggesting that the TMQ AP needs a firmware update to correct the error.” From the Nmea Standard: > The checksum is the 8-bit exclusive OR (no start or stop bits) of all characters in the sentence, including \",\" and \"^\" delimiters, between but not including the \"$\" or \"!\" and the \"*\" delimiters[emphasis added]. The hexadecimal value of the most significant and least significant 4 bits of the result is converted to two ASCII characters (0-9, A-F (upper case)) for transmission. The most significant character is transmitted first. The game SailAway sends realtime NMEA streams that can be used with plotter software, routing software, etc. The game developers have elected to send the RMC and GLL sentences with the “V” validity character, which indicates the data is invalid. OpenCPN rejects the data. An “A” character is required to show the data is valid. $GPGLL,2546.261,N,7959.8522,W,174650.217,V*3B $GPRMC,174650.217,V,2546.261,N,7959.8522,W,4.9,79,230320,,,*0D NMEAconverter can easily adjust these sentences and recalculate the checksum so that the data is accepted in OpenCPN. $XXRMC,$GPRMC1,A,$GPRMC3,$GPRMC4,$GPRMC5,$GPRMC6,$ GPRMC7,$GPRMC8,$GPRMC9,,, $XXGLL,$GPGLL1,$GPGLL2,$GPGLL3,$GPGLL4,$GPGLL5,A Thanks to Jurien72 and Rasbats CForum SOG/COG Problem To fix a temporary bug in OpenCPN 2018 which has since then been fixed.

The NASA Clipper GPS Repeater (which displays all bearings in magnetic) requires NMEA version 2.0 (or later version) and it appears that if the GPS Repeater doesn’t see the extra field it just assumes West variation. (Magnetic variation here in NZ is 22 degrees East). With the help of Dirk’s wonderful NMEAConverter plugin I was able to synthesise an XXRMC sentence from the incoming RMC from the GPS and adding an extra comma and \"A\" after the Magnetic Variation E or W field. By sending my \"synthetic\" XXRMC from OpenCPN instead of the ECRMC, the GPS Repeater magically shows the correct magnetic bearing of 338 degrees rather than 22 degrees previously when steering to a course of 0 degrees true. Example: $ECRMC,211808.00, A,4117.30837, S,17447.10970, E,0.007, ,310818,22.6,E*23 (RMC sentence generated by OpenCPN - no field after the last \"E\") $XXRMC,211808.00, A,4117.30837, S,17447.10970, E,0.007, ,310818,22.6,E,A*23 (Synthesised RMC sentence with extra field after the last \"E\") Could we please in the next release of OpenCPN, add the extra field in the ECRMC sentence to make it NMEA Version 2.3 compliant? This was fixed in the next release, so the above is not necessary. If you have an useful format formula please feel free to add it here. Another future possibility is to do a comparison lookup of a boat’s Polar data and send a special NMEA sentence of the comparative result to the Dashboard using a special dedicated performance instrument, for example.

Cases where the charts were installed directly on the computer with the access code. OpenCPN automatically recognizes their presence. The operating procedure is the same as with other charts. Just declare the directory charts in the “Maps” tab of the “Toolbox” Cases where the charts were installed on the computer and where the access code is on a dongle. You must insert the dongle into a USB port on the computer before launching OpenCPN. After that, the operating procedure is similar to that of other charts. Just declare the directory charts in the “Charts” tab of the “Options”. Each access to the charts, the dongle is red illuminated during the update of the database. (see pictures below) If you use a dongle and if the dongle is removed, access to nautical charts is stoped. It is useless to put the dongle to try to regain access to nautical charts. We must restart the access procedure: close OpenCPN return the dongle restart OpenCPN To retrieve the charts I purchased earlier NVcharts directed me to this website: NV-Chart Download There you can find the charts you purchased and you want to download by year of release. I found the Windward Islands kit but couldn’t find the Leeward Islands kit. Enter the charts you need to download and click on the download button. The charts will be downloaded as an exe file. Run the exe file and enter your serial numbers, name and email and then it will install the charts. They recommend saving them in C:Chartkit/BSB. That’s where I installed and then pointed Opencpn to that subdirectory and everything works well.","title":"","component":"nv_charts","version":"","name":"index","url":"/nv_charts/index.html","titles":[{"text":"NV Charts","hash":"_nv_charts","id":1},{"text":"Links","hash":"_links","id":2},{"text":"Get charts from NV-Verlag:","hash":"_get_charts_from_nv_verlag","id":3},{"text":"Installation charts procedure:","hash":"_installation_charts_procedure","id":4},{"text":"Install the plugin:","hash":"_install_the_plugin","id":5},{"text":"Enable the plugin:","hash":"_enable_the_plugin","id":6},{"text":"Manual:","hash":"_manual","id":7},{"text":"Retrieve Charts Previously Purchased.","hash":"_retrieve_charts_previously_purchased","id":8}]},"175":{"id":175,"text":"Debugger for the OpenCPN plugin API Source: Github Repository Releases: Github Releases Download: Website Download Forum: Debugger CF Thread We need a volunteer Editor to write this wiki manual!","title":"","component":"debugger","version":"0.1","name":"index","url":"/debugger/0.1/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Debugger","hash":"_debugger","id":1},{"text":"Links","hash":"_links","id":2},{"text":"Documentation","hash":"_documentation","id":3}]},"176":{"id":176,"text":"Allows search of named objects on S-57 and CM93 vector charts. Source: Github Download: Chart Object Search Forum: ObjSearch_pi Thread This document is about Object Search plugin (Search-pi) A. What does Search-pi do Object Search is a plugin that allows you to find charted items: you did not know exist you did know exist, but did not know the position of. Note: Object Search is for searching charted objects in VECTOR charts only. B. Why should I want it? Well… the answer is simple: You might want to know the position of a certain charted object (duh…). Charted objects can be buoys or other navigational aids, bridges, locks, land-area’s etc. C. What does Search-pi not do Read S-63 and oeSENC licensed and encrypted charts. The plugin cannot deal with the encrypted chart objects. Note: In this section the instructions are specifically for Search-pi, but there is a dedicated page in the manual with information about Downloading, Installing and Enabling Plugins in general. Search-pi can be downloaded from https://www.opencpn.org/OpenCPN/plugins/chartobject.html How to install the plug-in Make sure you choose the file that is compatible with your computersystem. In this manual we presume it’s Windows, so we choose the Windows setup-package. Download the file (double-click). We assume you know where to find the files you download from the Internet (if you don’t: quit now and read the manual of your computer before doing anything else with it. Double-click the downloaded file and follow the set-up instructions. That’s it. But before you can actually use the plug-in, you first have to enable that plug-in in OpenCPN. Open (or restart) OpenCPN. Click Tools-Options-Plugins Scroll down untill you see the Object Search-pi. Click “Enable”. Click “OK”. Now the Object Search-pi icon (it looks like a looking glass) should appear somewhere in your OpenCPN Toolbar. When you click the Object Search-pi icon, this menu will open. Let’s presume we want to search for a charted object with the name “M 13”. Why? Well, for example because you are sailing in Dutch waters. After visiting the National Lifeboat Museum in Den Helder (the gateway to the Dutch Waddensea) you plan a trip from Den Helder to the small fishing harbour of Den Oever, some 10 miles east of Den Helder. You are warned to stay well clear of the shallows directly south-east of buoy M 13. OK, now you know there is a buoy M 13 somewhere between Den Helder and Den Oever. But you want to know where exactly that buoy is. So you use Object Search to find “M 13” for you. Insert the text you want to search for and click “Search”. Click one of the Results and click “Show on chart”. Zoom in and there is your buoy “M 13”. And directly south-east of it that dreaded spit. Now as you can see, there are quite a few items in your “Results”. You can narrow the list of results down by adjusting the field “Limit range to”. “0” means “No Limit” and will give the longest list of results. There is even an item “VM 13” 94.5 miles away. That is not necessary and can be confusing. Let’s say in this example we expect the buoy M 13 to be within 5 miles from our boat’s position. Therefore we have set a limit of 5 Nmi. (“5” means “Search in a range of 5 Nautical Miles from the boat’s position”). That will narrow the list of results down considerably. And that is better manageable. Just four hits (and all four of them are about the buoy we are searching). Note: it’s obvious that if you set too small a limit (and the object you search is not within that limit) Object Search will not be able to find it! You can also adjust the settings via (you guessed it…) “Settings”. The first example is already given in the previous section. In that example you want to look-up an object that should be on your chart, you just don’t know it’s exact position. But here’s another example (OK, maybe a bit silly…): You are on a sailing trip on the South-West coast of Ireland. You have made it to Baltmore, County Cork, and are sitting in a bar, enjoying the local brew. The next leg of the trip will involve rounding Dursey Head. You mention that to one of the locals and he replies with “Oh, but then you should watch out for the bull!”. His mate says “Oh no, never mind the bull, you can see that from miles away. The heifer and her calf are far far more dangerous!”. Now this gives you an uneasy feeling. What the heck are they talking about? Why should a heifer be more dangerous than a bull? And a heifer and her calf? How’s that possible? (a heifer is a young cow before she has had her first calf). And besides: it’s a sailing trip, not a bloody hike through the fields! You are wondering what the ingrediënts of that local beer are, but before you can inquire further, the two locals leave the pub and you are left behind in utter confusion. When you are back on board of your ship, you start OpenCPN to run Object Search. Type in the “search” field “heifer” and click “search”. This might be the result: Click : “show on chart” and zoom in…. Ah… so that’s why the “heifer” and the “calf” are more dangerous than the “bull”. “The Bull” island (top left) has a lighthouse and the “Heifer” and “Calf” rocks south-east of The Bull and just off Dursey Head are a lot smaller and therefore less easily seen (and avoided by sailors like you). (nothing yet).","title":"Object Search","component":"objsearch","version":"0.1","name":"index","url":"/objsearch/0.1/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Links","hash":"_links","id":1},{"text":"What and Why","hash":"_what_and_why","id":2},{"text":"Installation","hash":"_installation","id":3},{"text":"Enabling the plug-in OpenCPN","hash":"_enabling_the_plug_in_opencpn","id":4},{"text":"Standard actions","hash":"_standard_actions","id":5},{"text":"Examples","hash":"_examples","id":6},{"text":"Frequently Asked Questions","hash":"_frequently_asked_questions","id":7}]},"177":{"id":177,"text":"Developer: Jon Gough Source: https://github.com/jongough/ocpn_draw_pi Releases: Github Releases Download: Website Download Forum: Ocpn_Draw Thread The Ocpn_Draw Plugin (OD) is designed to allow users to place objects/items on the OpenCPN interface and have these georeferenced. This allows the objects/items to move with the chart and have a defined Latitude and Longitude. There are two basic types of object/item that can be used: Points Paths Points are very similar to Waypoints and mark locations on the chart. Paths join two or more points together and draw a line between them. Currently these Points exist: Boundary Point (BP) Text Point (TP) Electronic Bearing Line (EBL) Point Dead Reckoning (DR) Point Guard Zone (GZ) Point These Points are used to construct special types of Paths: Boundary (B) Electronic Bearing Line (EBL) Dead Reckoning (DR) Guard Zone (GZ) Parallel Index Line (PIL) The example screen shot below shows an example of each type of Point and Path. One user’s Feature Request: “When Piloting the Range and Bearing of prominent bouys, chart features can be temporarily important as is the balance of the traffic. AIS proves the real time value of plotting these dynamic elements. Additionally, this point is reinforced where (Cursor) Range and Bearing is shown in places like the Dashboard or Status Bar. However, when piloting in unfamiliar waters it is useful to maintain an awareness of multiple landmarks. Much of the dead reckoning situational awareness in the absence of AIS targets is from Range and Bearing info, especially at night or in low visibility. A big benefit with respect to maintenance of situation awareness on deck. These range and bearing datapoints might be recorded/timestamped when arriving at designated DR waypoints as well. Range/Bearing Also, Useful when estimating arrival at a layline, given a known tacking angle and current heading” His Comment after learning of ODraw: “Thanks for the redirect. ODraw_PI works great for my purposes. We should definitely CLOSE this request….” There are two methods that plugins can use to interact with Ocpn_Draw_pi, the interactions are described for developers here: ODraw Messaging Ocpn_Draw_pi (OD) provides a graphics companion to Watchdog_pi (WD) Alarms. OD is used as a graphics tool to create Boundary Graphics and Boundary Point Graphics. WD will then create “Boundary Alarms” using the Boundary Graphics created by OD. The alarms that WD can create are (GPS proximity, GPS course & time, Anchor, AIS) depending on the alarm type WD may require a particular Boundary GUID or the alarm may apply to all boundaries that are displayed. The WD alarm types are separate and distinct from the OD graphics types (inclusive, exclusive, neither). OD knows nothing about the WD plugin, it just responds with information about specific Lat/Lon combinations. WD can use the graphic type that OD has to help filter which boundaries to look for. So if you have a large number of boundaries of mixed 'types' it would probably help if you selected the type of boundary to look for rather than use the default 'Any'. See the Development manual - Plugin Messaging - for messaging between ODraw , Watchdog and Weather_routing. A simple way to visualise the interactions between ODraw Boundaries and WatchDog boundaries alarms is laid out in this chart. The chart shows which OD Boundary objects will cause a WD alarm to ring. If the WD alarm is set to Exclusion, the alarm will ring, go off, if an Exclusion boundary is found within the alarm area, i.e. time or distance. However, no other type of boundary will cause the alarm to go off. So when you setup the alarms you need to check the above matrix to ensure you will get the alarm when you want it. You can set up multiple Dynamic Guard Zones and set the alarms for one, some or all of these zones. (Dynamic) Guard Zone Alarms are in some ways similar to the “AIS Collision Alarm” you can set in OpenCPN (Options-Ships-AIS Targets-CPA Calculation). But they are more versatile. Red hatched Boundary created with Ocpn_Draw and used in Weather Routing Configuration > Options > Basic Tab > Check “Detect Boundary” An extended API has been provisioned to allow other plugins to interact with the objects that OD supports. A new version of the Squiddio plugin is available which can make use of OD Text Points for the display of information. This removes the Squiddio waypoints from OCPN and replaces them with OD Text Points. This has the effect of decluttering the OCPN Routes and Waypoints Manager dialog. There is a new, extended, preferences dialog for Squiddio that allows the user to set various paramters for use with OD. As can be seen it is easy to change between OCPN and OD for the display of Squiddio information. The extra information below the selection of which component to use is a subset of the settings available for Text Points. To find out more about Text Points please read further down on the manual. There are currently two different format files that allow importing of Draw objects, these are: gpx and csv. Examples of both formats can be found here: https://github.com/jongough/ocpn_draw_pi/tree/master/examples. Both of these formats allow you to generate Draw objects from other data sources and then import them rather than having to create each object then modify them to get the correct attributes. The gpx format is an XML format file and is exactly the same as used by Draw for storing its objects over a restart. If you look in the 'ocpn_draw_pi/data' directory you will see one or more xml files these show all the attributes needed for creating a gpx file. Or if you want to generate your own gpx file then do an export of a single Draw object of the type you would like to import so that you have the complete structure which you can then modify and import. The following is an example (test export paths1.gpx): Boundary Point 2018-01-08T07:57:51Z Exclusion Triangle 24ed5a17-c01e-477a-a51b-dfa3368b6ba0 1 0 0.000 Boundary Point 2018-01-08T07:57:52Z Exclusion Triangle 4013a102-5ac4-47b0-a14a-bd2c3d3197be 1 0 0.000 Boundary Point 2018-01-08T07:57:53Z Exclusion triangle 39b37b4d-568d-406d-8a18-214d467181f0 1 0 0.000 Boundary Point 2018-01-08T07:57:54Z Exclusion triangle 24ea8aca-a730-4bb9-b3df-15db1267b19d 1 0 0.000 The CSV format file is to allow you to use a spreadsheet program to easily generate objects. Here is an example (test-boundary-import.csv): 'c', 'type(B)','name', 'boundary_type', 'visible(t/f)', 'line rgb-colour', 'rgb-fill-colour' 'B','test boundary1','Exclusion','t','rgb(0,255,0)','rgb(255,0,0)' 'c', 'type(BP)', 'name', lat, lon, 'boundary_type', 'visible', 'rings-visible(t/f)', 'rings-number', 'rings-step', 'rings-units(N/K)', 'rings-colour' 'BP','first',-23.00,154.00 'BP','second',-23.5,154.00 'BP','third',-23.5,154.50 'BP','fourth',-23.0,154.50 '/B' 'B','test boundary2','Exclusion' 'BP','first',-22.00,154.00 'BP','second',-22.5,154.00 'BP','third',-22.5,154.50 'BP','fourth',-22.0,154.50 '/B' 'BP','isolated',-22.70,154.70 'c', 'type(TP)', 'name', lat, lon, 'position (t/ct/b/cb/c/r/l)', 'show (a/r/n)', 'visible (t/f)', 'display text' 'TP','my test text point',-22.70,154.70,'cb','a','t','this is one long line and should be treated as such. It is not designed to wrap' 'TP','my multiline text point',-22.90,154.70,'cb','a','t','this is not one long line\\n and should not be treated as such.\\nIt is designed to wrap' The first label describes the type of line that follows, i.e. 'c' is a comment, 'B' is a Boundary, etc. Using this format in a spreadsheet will allow you to easily create multiple Draw objects and then import them when you have finished. This version of the plugin requires at least version of OpenCPN 5.xx.yy. It is not compatible with any version before this. The reason is that the user interface changed with OCPN 5 and a new graphics library was used. Download the plugin using OpenCPN Plugin Manager found in OpenCPN settings/Plugins. When OCPN_DRAW_PI is installed and activated you will see two new icons in the OpenCPN Toolbar, they will always appear together, but depending on the other plugins that are currently active may appear in different positions within the toolbar. The top icon is for the Draw Paths and Points Manger, the bottom icon is the Draw tool that was last used. This icon will change depening on the last tool used The top Icon is for the Draw Manager which gives the user control over each of the Drawing objects that have been created from the Draw Toolbar. Left click on the Drawing Manager menu and the Path & OD Point Manager dialog will be displayed. The Path & Point Manager has tabs for Paths, OD Points and Layers from which selected Drawing Objects can be Shown, Hidden, Deactivated, Centered, Deleted, Exported, Delete All, and Export All. Additionally a drawing object’s Properties can be accessed and changed. First select one or more Drawing Objects under a given Tab . Then select the desired Action on the right. For example: Select all Drawing Objects under Paths Tab , then select Delete . This will remove all of the Drawing Objects under Path Tab . Of course the quick alternative is to select Delete All . Properties, Deactivate and Center View are greyed out when more than one object is selected. The plugin has an interesting interface with two icons as shown above for Draw Manager and Draw Create . The bottom icon on the OCPN Toolbar, Draw Create, is dynamic and will show a different icon depending on which drawing object type has been selected. Click on the bottom icon on the OCPN Toolbar and a floating Draw Toolbar appears containing Draw Tools , with the last one used selected by default (appears depressed). Select the Drawing Tool needed. The above Draw Tools are for Boundary, then Boundary Points, Text points, EBL, DR, Guard Zone, and Parallel Index Line in that order. The Drawing Objects that are available are as follows: Boundary Boundary points Text points Electronic Bearing Lines (EBL) & Variable Range Marker (VRM) Dead Reckoning Guard Zone (GZ) Parallel Index Line (PIL) Depending on the settings you have chosen for Draw this toolbar may never be displayed, displayed whilst a drawing tool is in use or always displayed. There are 7 icons to choose between and each activates a different tool. The currently active tool icon will also show in the OCPN Toolbar when you are drawing. If you have finished drawing the last active tool is shown in the OCPN Toolbar for easy, quick, access to the last tool. Try drawing several of each type to learn how they work and what they create. You can select the next tool in sequence by right clicking the mouse prior to starting to draw. Once a left mouse click has been done the right click will terminate the 'create' drawing. You can also stop the 'create' mode by hitting 'Esc', left mouse clicking the selected tool in the main toolbar or by left mouse clicking on the close icon in the 'Draw Toolbar'. It sounds complicated, but you will find one of the methods should meet your normal usage requirements. Each tool has a cursor icon: Boundary: Pencil Boundary Point: Red Cross Text Point: 'I' icon EBL: Red Cross and a line joining the cursor to the boat DR: Red Cross GZ: Pencil PIL: Red Cross The DR tool does not draw based on the current cursor position, it brings up a dialog box that allows you to enter the DR information. When you left mouse click 'OK' the DR line will be drawn based on the information you have entered. The information that is first displayed is the default information entered into the properties panel or the current information available to OpenCPN, i.e. SOG and COG. Clicking on this icon will open the Draw Manager dialog box. This will allow you to interact with any of the Draw objects that have been drawn in the current session, including those that were loaded from the last OpenCPN session. There are three tabs, Paths, OD Points and Layers. Paths is the generic name for objects that have drawn lines, OD Points and the points on the display between which the lines are drawn and Layers are a waypoint of collecting Draw objects into groups that can be displayed or hidden by a single action. Eample pages: Paths OD Points Layers Drawing Objects imported into Layers are static and non editable. Use Layers in the same way as the OCPN Route and Waypoint manager does, i.e. Temporary Layers. It will bring in boundaries and points and show or hide them as required. You can load more than one layer file into the same layer, just select more than one file in the file manager popup and they will load into the same layer. To use Layers and move Drawing Objects into a temporary user created Layer, select them, Export Selected and then import then from the Layers tab Import. Layers can also be persistent meaning that the layer will be reloaded after a restart. By default persistent layers will not be shown, however, this behaviour can be changed by setting the Show Layers checkbox to a tick. Then all persistent layers will be shown over a restart. An OpenCPN user has provided a set of layers for use within Draw describing zoning in Queensland Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP), the Great Sandy Marine Park (GSMP) and the Moreton _Boundary Marine Park (MBMP). These show the usage allowed in each zone and the limits of such zones. These can be found here: https://github.com/redog666/qld-coastal-zones The following is an excerpt from the Moreton Bay area: First, if you are in the 'create' mode you must terminate this by, Right Click of mouse, button, Left Click on the tool you are using or hit 'Esc' on the keyboard. Then in the drawing hover over the object you wish to modify until a square yellow descriptor appears, then right click. The popup menu’s first line will identify the type of drawing object you have selected. Then there will be a action pick list, dependent on the object, such as Properties, Move.., Insert.. Deactivate.. Delete. Some drawing objects are made of several parts, (Boundary, Boundary Points, EBL & VRM, GZ and PIL) so it makes a difference where you hover and the condition of the object. 1. To select a Boundary, hover over the edges. To select a boundary point hover over it. 2. To select an EBL hover over the ends or the shaft, depending on whether the EBL is centered on a boat or lat/long the right click actions will be different. The popup menu list selections should be self explanatory. When you have right clicked and selected an action, for example to move a boundary, text point or boundary point, the point will be highlighted with a yellow dot. Complete the move by dragging and releasing. For editing any characteristics such as color, line thickness, font, etc, use 'Properties', but if you just want to move a point select 'Move'. To move a point you will need to right click and select move. Having selected move you will then need to put the cursor over the selected object, push and hold the left mouse button and drag the object to where you want it. When you let go of the left mouse button the cursor (what ever it was showing before) should revert to the standard pointer and the 'move' process is terminated. If you want to move the object again, you will have to right click again to get the popup and repeat the process. There are multiple ways to access an object’s Properties . In Path & Point Manager double click on a Drawing Object, Properties will appear. In the Drawing hover over the Drawing Object, right click and pick Properties . In the Drawing hover over the Drawing Object, double left click, Properties will appear. It is also possible to drill down into an object if it is multi-part, i.e. get a Boundary properties dialog displayed then right click or double click any line showing a Boundary point and the properties for that point will be displayed. When moving an object you can move it in any direction just by holding the left hand mouse button down and dragging. If you want to constrain the movement to horizontal or vertical you need to use the Ctrl key to only allow vertical movement or the Shift key to only allow horizontal movement. If you release the key whilst dragging the constraint is removed. You can press and hold one of the two keys at any time during the movement, the constraint only applies when the key is held down. Additionally, when used with EBL pressing Ctrl + Shift at the same time, will constrain the angle value and allow movement along the angle. This will also work when perpendicular line is checked. A boundary can be moved as a single object or a single line of the boundary can be moved. The default action is to move the whole boundary, but you can select 'Move Boundary Segment' from the right mouse button popup menu. If you have two or more boundaries you can select these and merge the boundaries together. This is accomplished by hold the Ctrl key down then left mouse clicking on the boundaries you want to merge. Each boundary selected will flicker showing it has been selected. If you then right click on a boundary you will be presented with a merge popup. This will allow you to merge and keep the current boundaries, this draws a bounding boundary around the selected boundaries. If you select merge and delete you will draw a bounding box around the boundaries then the original boundaries will be deleted. There is no undo, so care needs to be taken. This section will describe in more detail the drawing tools that are available with this Plug In. This allows drawing of a closed path joining all points that of the path. The smallest Boundary has two points, but normal Boundaries will have three (triangle) or more points. There is no limit to the number of points, or the size of the Boundary. When drawing points that have already been placed will be connected togther with the path line. A rubber band line will be drawn that follows the cursor. The boundary fill may appear incomplete or strange at this point. However, when the final point is place and the create process is finished it will correct itself and display the boundary fill correctly. If a point is placed in the wrong location carry on laying the other points. When you have finished the create process you can then edit the boundary and 'Move', 'Delete' or 'Add' more points to the boundary. If the whole boundary is in the wrong location it can be moved as a whole from the right mouse click menu. The types of boundary you can draw, which can be easily changed after creation if it is wrong, are: Exclusion - The interior of the boundary will have a cross hatch pattern of the selected color. The type of boundary reported to other plugins, such as Watchdog, will be of type 'Exclusion'. Inclusion - A user defined width cross hatch pattern will be drawn around the outside of the boundary in the selected color. The type of boundary reported to other plugins, such as Watchdog, will be of type 'Inclusion'. Neither - The boundary will be drawn as a line with no interior or exterior fill. The type of boundary reported to other plugins, such as Watchdog, will be of type 'Neither'. Please Note that these Types (exclusion, inclusion, neither) are Graphical only, and WatchDog does not use them in setting its internal alarms. We recommend that these graphic types be used appropriately to conform with the type of alarm that will be set from within WatchDog, however they will have NO EFFECT on the WD alarm type. The type of boundary may change what other plugins do with the information, or how it is displayed. If using the Watchdog plugin and you set the boundary anchor watch the alarm will go off if you move outside of the boundary. If you are motoring/sailing and you have a proximity boundary watch set then the alarm will go off if you get closer than the specified distance. The first type of boundary should be an 'Inclusion' boundary and the second should be an 'Exclusion' boundary. Note: A Boundary is a line joining two or more Boundary Points together. As such, each Boundary Point can have the same capabilities as individual Boundary Points. This allows the placing of individual points on the chart. They are very similar to 'Marks' that can be dropped by OpenCPN. However, they have the capability of being 'Exclusion', 'Inclusion' and 'Neither' boundary points. This is demonstrated when Range Rings are Displayed. Exclusion - The interior of the boundary point, from the biggest range ring, will have a cross hatch pattern of the selected color. The type of boundary point reported to other plugins, such as Watchdog, will be of type 'Exclusion'. Inclusion - A user defined width cross hatch pattern will be drawn around the outside of the largest range ring of the boundary point in the selected color. The type of boundary point reported to other plugins, such as Watchdog, will be of type 'Inclusion'. Neither - The boundary range rings will be drawn as a line with no interior or exterior fill. The type of boundary point reported to other plugins, such as Watchdog, will be of type 'Neither'. Please Note that these Types (exclusion, inclusion, neither) are Graphical only, and WatchDog does not use them in setting its internal alarms. We recommend that these graphic types be used appropriately to conform with the type of alarm that will be set from within WatchDog, however they will have NO EFFECT on the WD alarm type. Boundary Points continue to be placed on the chart until the drawing create mode is terminated. This allows the placing of as many points with single mouse left clicks as the user wishes. This allows the placing of individual Text Points on the chart. They appear very similar to Boundary Points, but they allow the displaying of multi-line text in the desired font. They can have range rings, but these cannot be filled. The text top left corner of the text is the reference point. There are 7 provided locations: Top - which puts the text over the top of the point aligned to the left edge of the icon with the bottom just clear of the icon Top center - which puts the text over the top of the point with the center of the text aligned to the center of the icon Bottom - which puts the top edge just underneath the point aligned to the left edge of the icon. If you displace the point name the text should drop enough to show it Bottom center - which puts the text underneath the point with the center of the text aligned to the center of the icon center - which puts the text horizontal and vertical center over the icon. Right - which puts the top edge aligned with the top of the icon, the left hand edge of the text just clear of the right hand side of the icon Left - which puts the top edge aligned with the top of the icon, the text to the left of the icon with the right hand end of the text box just clear of the icon The amount the box edge is offset is controlled by 8 settings in the opencpn ini/conf file. You will find them called: DefaultTextTopOffsetX DefaultTextTopOffsetY DefaultTextBottomOffsetX DefaultTextBottomOffsetY DefaultTextRightOffsetX DefaultTextRightOffsetY DefaultTextLeftOffsetX DefaultTextLeftOffsetY These are not in any dialog box as they are very unlikely to be modified. Changing the font in the properties box does not apply the font until the OK button is pressed on the properties box. The word 'Example' should change to show you the font selected. Changing the font in the properties box does not apply the font until the OK button is pressed on the properties box. The word 'Example' should change to show you the font selected. When a Text Point is created the 'natural' scale at which it is created is stored. This is then used to determine what to show when scaling to larger scales. Currently at twice the natural scale the text gets hidden and at 8x the natural scale the text box gets hidden. This is currently hard coded. To display text for the Text Point you will need to open the properties for the Text Point and fill in the 'Display Text' tab. This is simple text and does not allow individual formatting of different parts of the text. You can pick the font and the font metrics to use for all the text associated with one text point. The EBL always starts attached to the boat with the far end of the line being placed by left clicking the chart. The default action for the end point is set in the main properties dialog. The end point can either be fixed to a Latitude and Longitude or move along with the boat. This allows the EBL to show the boat moving against a fixed point, i.e. passing a reef, or to show other objects moving relative to the boat, i.e. when the boat can tack to get around a bouy. The EBL can be detached from the boat to allow placing of the start point where the user left clicks. The EBL can also then have the start point centerd on the boat but not move or re-attached to the boat. Variable Range Markers (VRM’s) can be displayed as part of the EBL, by checking a box on the EBL properties (or set the default on the OD properties) and a range ring will be drawn based on the start point. If the end point of the EBL is moved the range ring will move with that point. This allows easily setting up of safety rings around a boat. The plugin provides additional information when moving the end point of an EBL/VRM End Points A & B of an EBL can be in several states: 1. Associated with Boat position (boat lat long) - Moving with the boat. 2. Associated with a fixed position (lat long) - Not Moving with the boat. 3. When offset Point B is associated with Boat position (lat long) it moves relative to the boat position and stays at the same angle. Right click selections for EBL are 1. When the EBL start point is attached to the boat… Pick a new start point. 2. When the EBL start point is not on the boat.. Center on moving boat or Center on Lat/Lon (not fixed to the boat) This flexibilty is useful for Dead Reckoning to have “Fixed” EBL markers. The default color is the same as for a 'Boundary Point' and it will draw 1 range ring. If you want to change that then you will need to get to the start point properties (double click the EBL and double click the first point), or if the first point is clearly visible, just go to its properties (right click the point and select properties) and you can change the number of rings, the colors. The rings cannot be filled. The VRM colour, by default is set to the same as the default for a Boundary Point, but once you change the VRM color to be different from the Boundary Point default then it will stay this way, unless you select the match option in the right click menu. There are two ways of changing the VRM color: Under properties for the EBL with the VRM showing. Change the EBL color and the VRM color will also change. Under properties for the EBL with the VRM showing get the properties of the 'boat'/'start' point and change the color. It may seem strange at first to use an EBL to give you the VRM, but it makes selecting the VRM easier so that it can be dragged to the size required as there is a well defined point that can be selected. This is particularly true if you have many VRM’s at one time. It is not necessary to loop through the preferences to enable the VRM for one EBL–the settings pop-up double clicking the EBL has all the necessary entries. The popup for EBL’s contains both the forward and back bearing. The main properties dialog in the general tab sets whether to use magnetic bearings or true. If magnetic is used then if you have the World Magnetic Model installed the variation will be used from that plugin. If not you will, currently, need to set 'UserMagVariation=0.00' in the ocpn_draw_pi section of the config file as there is no setting in the properties dialog for this. This draws a Dead Reckoning line with multiple points along it starting at the boats current location. As mentioned above, this tool does not use the mouse click to draw on the chart, rather it uses it to display a dialog box where the DR information can be entered. When the 'OK' button is clicked the DR will be created and drawn on the chart. At this point the line can be modified by changing the points that make it up. However, this may make the DR line not reflect what you expect as neither the time/distance between points is maintained, nor is the COG/SOG. So the DR line at that point becomes more of a line with possibly little meaning in the context of DR. This draws a segment of a torus or doughnut. The centre is the boat and the angle and size is determined from the two points that are used to describe the GZ. When the GZ tool is selected the cursor will change to a pencil and a line will join it to the centre of the boat. When the left mouse button is clicked the first point of the GZ is dropped. Now when the mouse pointer is moved an angular segment of a torus is drawn, the size of which is determined based on where the mouse cursor is. The second point is dropped when the left mouse button is clicked. This completes the drawing of the GZ which will now be the default colour and filled in with a hatch of the default colour. The GZ can rotate with the boat and be maintained with the heading or the coarse over ground. Or it can maintain its position relative to the boat irrespective of which direction the boat is moving. This is set in the default propertiesd but can also be changed for each individual GZ. Annex to IMO res.A893(21)-Guidelines For Voyage Planning. Section 4- Appraisal “Additional information which should be marked on the charts include: ….. Parallel index lines should also be drawn where appropriate.” Annex to IMO res.A893(21)-Guidelines For Voyage Planning. Section 6- Monitoring, point (j) “Radar can be used to advantage in monitoring the position of the vessel by the use of parallel indexing, which is a simple and most effective way of continuously monitoring that a vessel is maintaining its track in restricted coastal waters. Parallel indexing can be used in any situation where a radar-conspicuous navigation mark is available and it is practicable to monitor continuously the vessel’s position relative to such an object. It also serves as a valuable check on the vessel’s progress when using an electronic chart.” This allows drawing a line which offset from a centre line by a specified amount. This offset line will move with the boat and can either rotate with the boat or stay at a specified angle. Drawing a PIL is the same as drawing an EBL. The index line only shows up when the centre line has been drawn. Each PIL centre line can have multiple offset lines. To create more than the first line right click the centre PIL line and select 'Add Index Line'. A new index line will be drawn based on the default settings. End Points A & B of an PIL can be in several states: 1. Associated with Boat position (boat lat long) - Moving with the boat. 2. Associated with a fixed position (lat long) - Not Moving with the boat. 3. When offset Point B is associated with Boat position (lat long) it moves relative to the boat position and stays at the same angle. Right click selections for PILL are 1. When the EBL start point is attached to the boat… Pick a new start point. 2. When the EBL start point is not on the boat.. Center on moving boat or Center on Lat/Lon (not fixed to the boat) The offset line has its own properties box which can be accessed by either right clicking the offset line or by double left clicking the offset line. Each offset line can be moved using either left drag (if enabled) or right clicking the line and selecting move. How to use PIL Good Parallel Index Line video link How to plot for Collision Avoidance Collision Avoidance Plotting Part1 of 3 All objects that have been drawn have a properties dialog associated with them to allow changing of the objects attributes. You can display the point properties by either double left mouse clicking on the particular line you want in the Points list or by right mouse clicking on the line, once it has been selected, and selecting 'Boundary Point Properties' from the popup menu. If you want to remove a particular point then left click the line to select it. Then right mouse click on the point and select 'Remove Selected' from the popup menu. These are the properties for the selected Boundary Point. Any changes here will be made to the selected Boundary Point and, if the 'OK' button is clicked, will be preserved over a restart. This allows you to stop displaying the Boundary Point on the screen and change the GUID if you want. You will need to click 'OK' to save the changes. This tab controls the text that is displayed for the Text Point. Any changes here will be made to the selected Text Point and, if the 'OK' button is clicked, will be preserved over a restart. This tab is used to create and modify the text that will be displayed with the Text Point. It also allows the setting of values for an individual Text Point where as in the Preferences you settup the system wide settings. This is the same as for a Boundary Point These are the properties for the selected EBL Point. Any changes here will be made to the selected EBL Point and, if the 'OK' button is clicked, will be preserved over a restart. This is the same as for a Boundary Point. These are the properties for the selected DR Point. Any changes here will be made to the selected DR Point and, if the 'OK' button is clicked, will be preserved over a restart. This is the same as for a Boundary Point Copy and paste Lat/lon point In any of the 'Point' property dialogs you can right click in either the Lat or Lon and get a drop down menu where you can select: Copy Copy Lat/Lon Paste Paste Lat/Lon These will either copy/past in the selected box or will copy/paste both the Latitude and Longitude at the same time. Options > Plugins > Ocpn Draw > Preferences Under Preferences the Tabs are General, Boundary, Boundary Point, Text Point, Path, EBL, DR, DR Point, Guard Zone, Parallel Index Line, About and Help where various settings are selected. Generally the defaults should give a reasonable starting point. However, all the defaults that are used can be changed from here. This setting determines whether a dialog box will be shown asking for conformation about deleting any objects. With it checked you will be asked to confirm all deletes, with it unchecked you will be able to delete any object without being asked for confirmation. If you do delete an object by mistake and you have 'Nav Object Backups' set to more than 0, you will be able to use one of those backups to restore your objects. This setting saves the position of each dialog over a restart. If the user moves a dialog it will be in the same position when it is displayed after a restart. If this setting is not checked the default position, centre of the OCPN screen, will be used when the dialog is first displayed after a restart If this is checked and there is a magnetic variation available then this will be applied to all angles that are used within the plugin. If it is checked and there is no magnetic variation available it will assume a '0' variation. This setting allows dragging objects by placing the mouse over the object, pressing and holding the left mouse button and dragging the object to the desired location. If this setting is off you will need to right click on the object to get the popup menu and select move from that. Then you can press and hold the left mouse button and drag the object. A word of warning from user Redog: If “Allow Left Mouse Button Drag” is checked it is very easy to move your entire boundary or zone to a new location, thus changing all coordinates of waypoints you may have painstakingly entered. If you only intend to move 1 waypoint leave unchecked and use right click and move waypoint. If you intend to move entire zone check this option, it is a brilliant concept and very useful. This checkbox hides, unchecked, or shows, checked, layers on restart. This setting determines how many backups to keep of the navigation objects file. The location of the files can be found in the opencpn.log file. Each time OpenCPN stops a new copy of the navigation obj file will be created. The latest file is called 'ODnavobj.xml'. This is the percentage of the screen size distance from the edge that will cause the screen to pan when using the drawing tools. The bigger this number the further from the edge of the screen your pointer will be when the screen starts panning. This is the same as above, but is used after a drawing tool is picked but before the first object is created. This is supplied so that the screen does not start panning if you move your pointer off of the toll bar near the edge of the screen. If the OCPN Draw toolbar is not the required size this item allows scaling of the icons. On most systems this will require restarting OpenCPN, or deactivating and reactivating OCPN Draw. The plugin allows you to use two graphical methods of selecting the tool you wish to draw with: The main Toolbar and the right mouse click The Draw Toolbar This setting determines if the tool bar is display and has three settings Never - the toolbar is not displayed Whilst Drawing - the toolbar is displayed whilst a drawing tool is active Always - the toolbar will display all the time irrerspective of whether you are using the plugin. This setting allows the user to set all settings back to the default value. If the button has the label 'Yes' and it is clicked this will ensure that no OCPN Draw settings are saved when OCPN is shut down. The text of the label will be changed to 'Remove OCPN_Draw setting and restore to default on restart (Yes)' to indicate what will happen. The button label will now say 'No' indicating what will hapen if it is clicked again. This is the color of an active Boundary Line Selection is by a platform specific color picker. This will allow the color to be any RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color that is supported by the platform. This is the default color to use for any active Boundary fill hash. When selected a standard, platform dependent, color picker will be presented. This will allow the color to be any RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color that is supported by the platform. This is the color of an inactive Boundary Line. Selection is by a platform specific color picker. This will allow the color to be any RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color that is supported by the platform. This is the default color to use for any inactive Boundary fill hash. When selected a standard, platform dependent, color picker will be presented. This will allow the color to be any RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color that is supported by the platform. This is the width of the Boundary Line in pixels. It can be a value between 1 and 10 pixels. This defines how the Boundary Line is drawn. It can be one of the following: Solid Dot Long Dash Short Dash Dot Dash Some of these may not display well on your screen depending on the resolution you are using. It is known that when using high resolution screens, i.e. 3800×1900 the difference between the line types may be difficult to see. This allows the setting of how transparent the fill hash is. A value of 0 means that it is fully transparent and a value of 255 is that it is fully opaque. The term density is used as it seemed clearer, i.e. low density - you can see through it, high density - you cannot see through it. This defines, in pixels, how wide the hash is around the outside Boundary Line when the Boundary is of type 'Inclusion'. This radio button selection sets the default type for all Boundary. Points. Exclusion - fill the inside of the Boundary with a hash. Inclusion - surround the Boundary with a nominated size hash Neither - just draw the Boundary Line with no hash This sets whether to show or not the boundary points on a boundary. This is not really relevant to a Boundary Point at the moment, but may become useful if other items/capabilities are added This is the default setting for showing the Boundary Point name. Currently Boundary Points are created with the name empty/blank so nothing displays. This is the default icon to use for all Boundary Points. There is a set of OpenCPN icons that can be used as well as user defined icons. The method of adding user defined icons is documented in the main OpenCPN manual Boundary Points can have range rings associated with them. To show the rings by default this setting needs to be checked. This radio button selection sets the default type for all Boundary Points. Exclusion - fill the inside range rings with a hash. Inclusion - surround the largest range ring with a nominated size hash Neither - just draw the range rings but there is no hash This allows the setting of how transparent the fill hash is. A value of 0 means that it is fully transparent and a value of 255 is that it is fully opaque. The term density is used as it seemed clearer, i.e. low density - you can see through it, high density - you cannot see through it. This defines, in pixels, how wide the hash is around the outside Boundary Point Range Ring when the Boundary Point is of type 'Inclusion'. This defines the number of range rings to show if they are selected to be shown. If Zero is selected, then there will be no range ring shown. This is the gap between sucessive range rings. The measurement this is using is defined in the Distance Unit' setting The unit of measurement to use for the range rings gap. It can be: Nautical Miles Kilometers This is the default color to use for any Boundary Point Range Ring. When selected a standard, platform dependant, color picker will be presented. This will allow the color to be any RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color that is supported by the platform. This is the width of the range rings when drawn in pixels. It can be a value between 1 and 10 pixels. This defines how the Range Rings are drawn. It can be one of the following: Solid Dot Long Dash Short Dash Dot Dash Some of these may not display well on your screen depending on the resolution you are using. It is known that when using high resolution screens, i.e. 3800×1900 the difference between the line types may be difficult to see. This is the default icon to use for all Text Points. There is a set of OpenCPN icons that can be used as well as user defined icons. The method of adding user defined icons is documented in the main OpenCPN manual. This selects where the text is positioned relative to the location of the Text Point. If you show an Icon it will be easier to see and interact with the text on the screen. If you do not use an Icon it may be easier to use the Path Manager to get to the Text Point. There are 7 different locations: Top Top center Bottom Bottom center center Right Left This is the color that the default Display Text will have. Selection is by a platform specific color picker. This will allow the color to be any RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color that is supported by the platform. When a Text Point displays text it will have a colored background to help it stand out from the underlying chart. This is the default color of the background box. This will allow the color to be any RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color that is supported by the platform. This allows the setting of how transparent the background color. A value of 0 means that it is fully transparent and a value of 255 is that it is fully opaque. The term density is used as it seemed clearer, i.e. low density–you can see through it, high density–you cannot see through it. The default density is 100. This selects either Font metric based sizing or Charcter count for wrapping the displayed text. In Font Based the font being used will determine where the wrapping occurs. In Character Based the count of the characters will determine where the wrapping occurs. This is the default for when the Display Text of a Text Point is shown. Always - Display text is always shown On Rollover Only - The text will be displayed when the mouse pointer rolls over the Text Point. This is to try and help declutter the screen if there are many objects being concurrently displayed. Never - The display text is not displayed Depending on the selection of Maximum Width Type will determine the meaning of this number. In Font Based it is a virtual number more closely related to the number of pixels available to display the text. In Character Based this is the count of the maximum number of characters allowed on any line. In Font Based the text will only be wrapped if there is a space in the text. Also, if the value is set too low there will be now wrapping of the text. To use this method you will need to tune your value dependent on the font being used. There is no relationship between this number and the number of characters that will be used on any particular line. In Character Based this is the maximum number of characters that will be displayed on any line. Line breaks will occur on spaces, if they are available, but if there are no spaces then the line will be broken at this number of characters. This is the default font to be used for the 'Display Text'. The 'Fonts' button will allow picking of any font that is installed on the system. You can pick the Family, Style and Size of the font. This is presented by a platform specific font picker. The current font that will be used is shown by the work 'Example' which will be drawn using the font selected. This is the color of an active generic Path if there is no specific type. Currently this is not used as there are no unspecified Path types in use. Selection is by a platform specific color picker. This will allow the color to be any RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color that is supported by the platform. This is the color of an inactive generic Path if there is no specific type. Currently this is not used as there are no unspecified Path types in use. Selection is by a platform specific color picker. This will allow the color to be any RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color that is supported by the platform. This is the width of the Path Line in pixels. It can be a value between 1 and 10 pixels. This defines how the Path Line is drawn. It can be one of the following: Solid Dot Long Dash Short Dash Dot Dash Some of these may not display well on your screen depending on the resolution you are using. It is known that when using high resolution screens, i.e. 3800×1900 the difference between the line types may be difficult to see. This is the default icon to use for the start point of an EBL. There is a set of OpenCPN icons that can be used as well as user defined icons. The method of adding user defined icons is documented in the main OpenCPN manual. This is the default icon to use for the end point of an EBL. There is a set of OpenCPN icons that can be used as well as user defined icons. The method of adding user defined icons is documented in the main OpenCPN manual. This is the color of an active EBL. Selection is by a platform specific color picker. This will allow the color to be any RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color that is supported by the platform. This is the color of an inactive EBL. Selection is by a platform specific color picker. This will allow the color to be any RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color that is supported by the platform. This is the width of the EBL in pixels. It can be a value between 1 and 10 pixels. This defines how the EBL is drawn. It can be one of the following: Solid Dot Long Dash Short Dash Dot Dash This the default for all EBLs. This fixes the End Point of an EBL such that when the boat moves the end point does not. If this is left uncheck the end point of the EBL will move with the boat so the EBL always has the same length and bearing. This is the default for all EBLs. If checked a direction arrow will be displayed on the EBL at or near the end point. This helps show the direction of the EBL. This draws a Variable Range Marker (Ring) centered on the start point and sized to go through the end point. This shows a line drawn perpendicular to the end of the EBL. The line uses the same attributes as are applied to the EBL itself. The EBLs that are created can be: Persistent - will persist over a restart of OpenCPN Persistent over Crash - will not persist over a normal restart of OpenCPN, but will be persistent over a crash of OpenCPN Never - the EBL will only be temporary and will not be displayed again when OpenCPN is restarted. This is the color of an active DR Line Selection is by a platform specific color picker. This will allow the color to be any RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color that is supported by the platform. This is the color of an inactive DR Line. Selection is by a platform specific color picker. This will allow the color to be any RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color that is supported by the platform. This is the width of the DR line in pixels. It can be a value between 1 and 10 pixels. This defines how the DR line is drawn. It can be one of the following: Solid Dot Long Dash Short Dash Dot Dash This is the default speed over the ground to use when calculating the DR line. This is the default course over ground to use. The type, True or Magnetic, is determined by the setting in the General tab. This is the default length of the DR line. This is the default interval to place points along the DR path. This is the default length type to be used, either Time or Distance. This is the default interval between placing points, either Time or Distance. This is the default distance units to use, either Kilometers or Nautical Miles This is the default time units to use, one of Minutes, Hours or Days The DR lines that are created can be: Persistent - will persist over a restart of OpenCPN Persistent over Crash - will not persist over a normal restart of OpenCPN, but will persist over a crash of OpenCPN Never - the DR line will only be temporary and will not be displayed again when OpenCPN is restarted. This is the default icon to use for the all points of a Dead Reckoning line. There is a set of OpenCPN icons that can be used as well as user defined icons. The method of adding user defined icons is documented in the main OpenCPN manual. Boundary Points can have range rings associated with them. To show the rings by default this setting needs to be checked. This defines the number of range rings to show if they are selected to be shown. If Zero is selected, then there will be no range ring shown. This is the gap between successive range rings. The measurement this is using is defined in the 'Distance Unit' setting The unit of measurement to use for the range rings gap. It can be: Nautical Miles Kilometers This is the default color to use for any DR Point Range Ring. When selected a standard, platform dependant, color picker will be presented. This will allow the color to be any RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color that is supported by the platform. This is the width of the range rings when drawn in pixels. It can be a value between 1 and 10 pixels. This defines how the Range Rings are drawn. It can be one of the following: Solid Dot Long Dash Short Dash Dot Dash Some of these may not display well on your screen depending on the resolution you are using. It is known that when using high resolution screens, i.e. 3800×1900 the difference between the line types may be difficult to see. This is the default icon to use for the first point placed when creating a Guard Zone (GZ). There is a set of OpenCPN icons that can be used as well as user defined icons. The method of adding user defined icons is documented in the main OpenCPN manual. This is the default icon to use for the second point placed when creating a Guard Zone (GZ). There is a set of OpenCPN icons that can be used as well as user defined icons. The method of adding user defined icons is documented in the main OpenCPN manual. The method of adding user defined icons is documented in the main OpenCPN manual. This is the color of an active Boundary Line Selection is by a platform specific color picker. This will allow the color to be any RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color that is supported by the platform. This is the default color to use for any active Boundary fill hash. When selected a standard, platform dependent, color picker will be presented. This will allow the color to be any RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color that is supported by the platform. This is the color of an inactive Boundary Line. Selection is by a platform specific color picker. This will allow the color to be any RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color that is supported by the platform.

This defines how the Boundary Line is drawn. It can be one of the following: Solid Dot Long Dash Short Dash Dot Dash Some of these may not display well on your screen depending on the resolution you are using. It is known that when using high resolution screens, i.e. 3800×1900 the difference between the line types may be difficult to see. This allows the setting of how transparent the fill hash is. A value of 0 means that it is fully transparent and a value of 255 is that it is fully opaque. The term density is used as it seemed clearer, i.e. low density - you can see through it, high density - you cannot see through it. This locks the GZ to either the heading the course over ground of the boat. If this is unset then the GZ will move with the boat but will be at a fixed direction from the boat irrespective of its course or heading. This setting works with the 'Rotate with Boat' specifying whether to use the current heading or the course over ground. This defines, in pixels, how wide the hash is around the outside Boundary Line when the Boundary is of type 'Inclusion'. The GZs that are created can be: Persistent - will persist over a restart of OpenCPN Persistent over Crash - will not persist over a normal restart of OpenCPN, but will be persistent over a crash of OpenCPN Never - the GZ will only be temporary and will not be displayed again when OpenCPN is restarted.

This page provides useful information in the event you have problems with the Plug In. Please provide the version number and the patch number with any reported incident. You should also provide the version number of OpenCPN as this will help identify where the issue may be. This page provides information on the interaction of this plugin with the Watchdog plugin. This shows when alarms should ring for various boundary types. OCPN_Draw uses a set of directories to hold information and data, these directories are within the OpenCPN directory structure but linked to this plugin. The directories which are used are platform and installation dependent, however, the location can be found in the 'OCPN Draw Properties' dialog under the 'About' tab. This dialog is accessible from the 'OpenCPN Options', 'Plugins' dialog page. This will show the location of the 'data' sub-directory where the ODnavobj.xml files are kept. The other directories are siblings of the data directory and are 'Layers' and 'UserIcons', which hold data related to their names. Match It might be nice to have a way to “match” a text entity which is a way of copying all the font, color, background color and transparency information. To clone the properties of an object and not necessarily the object itself. So, the idea is to copy some of the attributes, colour, text, icon from one point to another, but leaving the lat, lon, GUID, name? remember the “the change all icons for boundaries” you have implemented already. Jobe39 has created a Simple Python File to convert gpx file from http://www.anchoragesincroatia.net/p/map-download.html for the OpenCPN draw plugin. See Github repository Also see Feature Request - Import GPX files for anchorages in croatia #386 for information about the process. The EBL is really defined as a length and direction from a starting point, the default being the boat. The ODPoints that are used are to enable moving the end points to a user selected location, which really translates into a length and direction. If you fix the end point, i.e. it does not move with the boat (a check box is available for this in the properties) then the end point lat/lon is stable and does not change, this allows the user to then input the lat/lon they wish. If they then allow the end point to move, uncheck the check box, it will use the new lat/lon as the starting point for the EBL. Copying the lat/lon of a moving point would probably not give you the answer you were hoping for. As the end point changes as the boat moves and rotates, the real life probability of getting the lat/lon you thought you would is unlikely. The way of showing that the lat/lon is changing is by making these fields read only, i.e. you cannot interact with them in any way, so there is no way to get the event for copying them.

These - non free - charts give OCPN access to up-to-date and proven charts for areas where those are not available for free. Different from S-63 or genuine S-57 charts (US), these are not “Official Charts” in the context of “carriage requirements”, as they are not issued or certified by official bodies. Even if the content is the same. The charts are delivered in an encrypted format optimized for OpenCPN called oeSENC and are requiring the corresponding oeSENC plug-in. They appear like all the other vector charts in S-57 format and can be quilted and managed identically. In the case of charts licensed from the Australian AHS the charts are called oeEVC due to legal reasons. The oeSENC plug-in will handle these files same as the oeSENCs. Same as in the case of the S-63 plug-in, the operational part is managed by an outside entity, o-charts.org. The charts are available at its web shop.

Using the program 'Show Currents' icon a set of arrows for the tidal current are displayed and also the rate of the current. These arrows are in a single colour. No value for direction is shown. oTCurrent allows the selection of a different date/time for the tidal current prediction. Also, using the 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons the user can 'step through' the time of the prediction. Direction and rate can both be shown. IMPORTANT: The times selected/shown use the same time zone as your computer. The tidal current displayed should be checked against official publications. Install and enable using the Plugin Manager. Select the 'tcdata' folder of OpenCPN. The plugin can work with the 'tcd' files from OpenCPN 5.6. It can also work with a HARMONIC.IDX file. Select the folder where the file is located. Enable the plugin by using Options→Plugins and ticking the Enable box. While the 'Options' screen is open user preferences can be set. The user can decide whether text values of rate and direction are shown against the tidal arrows. Arrows can be 'solid fill' or 'outline'. 'Fill Colour' makes the arrows 'solid fill'. The colour of the arrows can be changed. For users with a high resolution display there is an option to adjust the plugin dialog to match those displays. These selections are saved in the Config file. For Android 'solid fill’and arrow colour are not implemented. After enabling the plugin and pressing 'Apply' the oTCurrent icon appears on the toolbar. Press the icon to start seeing tidal arrows. Unlike the arrows displayed by the standard OpenCPN program you will need to be zoomed in, to a scale greater than 1:50000. Pressing 'Next' steps the time ahead by the interval set in the 'Step' box. Pressing 'Previous' steps the time back by this interval. The 'Now' (Clock) button shows the tidal current for the present time. Dates in the future can be chosen, using the 'Select' button. You will need a Harmonic.idx file on your computer, other than the one installed as part of the standard OpenCPN 5.6 installation, this file can be selected with the 'Select tidal current data' button. image::ot_browse_button.png[] Return to 'Tools/Options/Preferences' if you wish to change whether text is displayed for direction or rate. Also to change the color used for a range of speed (Not Android). For high resolution displays there is an option to improve the plugin output for those displays. No arrows are shown. How do I show them? Is the chart zoomed in to a sufficiently large scale? Are you using a Harmonic.idx file? My sailing area is Europe. Can tidal currents (streams) be displayed? Unofficial Harmonic.idx files are available for some European waters. For Linux users: If you are using V10 please rename HARMONIC.idx as HARMONIC.IDX. Without this change you will not see any arrows or current information with the plugin.","title":"oTCurrent","component":"otcurrent","version":"","name":"index","url":"/otcurrent/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Links","hash":"_links","id":1},{"text":"1.

Source: Github Repository Releases: Github Releases Forum: oTidalRoute Plugin Thread To select the optimum time for starting a route, taking into account tidal currents. OpenCPN 4.2.0 and above. Calculate routes showing estimated positions along a route in areas affected by tidal currents. Select the optimum departure time for the route. Download the plugin installer and run the installer .exe file from here (Windows): https://github.com/Rasbats/otidalroute_pi/releases Tidal current GRIB files can be downloaded from a number of websites. For a site with easy access try: www.sailingweatheronline.com Open the toolbox and enable 'oTidalRoute'. Apply/Ok and on the toolbar you will find the oTidalRoute icon. Because you need tidal current GRIB files it is probably better to start the Grib plugin at this stage. If the icon is not shown on the toolbar enable it using Options→Plugins and then start the Grib plugin. Start the oTidalRoute plugin. All the tools needed are now in place. Draw the proposed route on the chart. Make sure that the route passes through areas of the GRIB where current values are available. This means the route must fall within squares of the GRIB where there is a data point at each corner. If the cursor is moved into areas with only 3 data points the current direction/speed in the Grib plugin will show 'N/A'. An example of where the example route had to be adjusted is here: If the route had been closer to 'Gregory Rocks' it would not have passed through a 'square' of data points and the current data would not have been available. The plugin needs a GPX file of the route to work with. Give the route a name and export it as a GPX file to a location where you can easily find it. Returning to the oTidalRoute dialog enter the planned speed for the route. The departure time is entered by selecting a time from the Grib plugin. The tidal current data for that time covers a period from 30 minutes before to 30 minutes after the time shown in the Grib plugin. For this reason the departure time appearing in oTidalRoute will be 30 minutes before the Grib plugin time. Enter the name for the output route, which will have the estimated positions (EP). If you want a GPX file for the EP route tick the box. The route can be charted from the plugin so there is often no need for this file. In order to produce a comparison of different departure times the number of these can be set with the drop-down. Initially set this as '1' to check the plugin works. The plugin dialog will then look like this: Press 'Calculate EP'! A selection box opens to allow you to select the route GPX file you saved earlier. If you have decided to save a GPX file of the route with EPs a further selection dialog opens for the output file. The calculation may fail. If this happens even if the route looks compatible with the GRIB try making a simple test route well away from land. If the plugin has worked you will get this message: For a summary of the EP route select the menu option Routes→Summary. For a table showing distances/courses to steer/tidal current for each leg use Routes→Route Tables. Select the route and press 'Route Table'. If the route needs to be plotted on the chart press 'Chart Route'. For choosing the optimum departure time use the drop-down to choose the number of departures. Then 'Calculate EP'. You will need to choose a new name for the route or delete the existing route. After the calculation the summary shows each of the routes and the estimated time for each. The distance varies slightly due to rounding errors in the calculation. Biggest issue is getting the route to run through areas where there is GRIB data. The menu offers other options, including a short instruction guide.","title":"oTidalRoute","component":"otidalroute","version":"","name":"index","url":"/otidalroute/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Links","hash":"_links","id":1},{"text":"Aim","hash":"_aim","id":2},{"text":"Requirements","hash":"_requirements","id":3},{"text":"1.

Using OpenGL it is possible to adjust the transparency of the GeoTiff photo overlay.This allows the comparison of features from the photo overlay with those shown on the chart. Where hydrographic surveys have not been carried out recently and the charts are not to WGS84 standard the photo overlay may provide a better guide to pilotage. This photo overlay is for a marina in the Canary Islands. Note the position of the breakwaters. OpenCPN 4.2.0 and above. In some areas of the world a satellite chart is more accurate than the official chart. This plugin acts as a viewer for GeoTiff files. The GeoTiffs are made from satellite photos and they can also be obtained from other sources. If using OpenCPN 5.2 or later use the Plugin Manager. For older versions (Windows) use the .exe from here: https://github.com/Rasbats/photolayer_pi/releases Mac OS users note that libgeotiff is needed. See Satellite geotiffs with transparency and perhaps you have forgotten to install libgeotiff from homebrew? GeoTiff sources and the procedure for downloading these files is shown in this section. If making a KAP chart from a GeoTiff set the number of colours in 'Preferences' to, say, 64. The default setting of '2' will not work. Open the toolbox and enable 'PhotoLayer'. At the same time make sure that you are using OpenGL (Display → Advanced → Use Accelerated Graphics (OpenGL)) Apply/Ok and on the toolbar you will find the PhotoLayer icon. Start the PhotoLayer plugin. File → Open and select a GeoTiff. The location will change to match the photo overlay, which will appear superimposed. By moving the top transparency slider the transparency can be adjusted. Complete transparency is shown here. And no transparency with maximum brightness of the overlay is here. If you were not using OpenGL the transparency slider would not have worked. The brightness slider would have produced a picture like this. At maximum the overlay will disappear. The menu offers other options. “Save As” allows you to save a .png image, made from the overlay file. Some distortion is noted. “Goto” can be used if there are several overlays in the list, to move between the overlays. “Preferences” is used in combination with the “Export” facility, which will create a kap chart file from the overlay. Set the number of colours as required. 64 works well. File→Export creates and saves the kap. In order to display the kap it is necessary to update the chart database. And the photo chart is displayed. Because of the kap format it is not possible to adjust the transparency of the photo chart. The GeoTiff must be used. Menu “Delete” is to remove a GeoTiff from the list of overlays that have been opened. It does not delete the image file. The VentureFarther website https://www.venturefarther.com allows the selection of an area, which can be downloaded as a GeoTiff. You will need to register with VentureFarther and obtain your API key: https://www.venturefarther.com Please read the 'Credits' page on the VentureFarther website. 1 Credit is used for each single satellite chart download. Making a 'Multi-Chart' download will use 9 credits, because it consists of 9 satellite charts. Credits can be earned by submitting cruising information or you may choose to purchase an annual subsciption. The source is chosen and the slider moved from “KAP” to “GEO”. “Generate Chart” creates the GeoTiff which is downloaded to your system. It will appear in the directory you have chosen for file downloads from the Internet. The GeoTiff can be opened with PhotoLayer. The transparency of the overlay can be adjusted, unlike the normal kaps from VentureFarther. The SASPlanet program can be downloaded The download is a zip file. Extracting the zip creates a folder “SAS.Planet.xxxxxxx”, in which is “SASPlanet.exe” which starts the program (from the folder). Open the map which will be used to create the GeoTiff. This time a topographical map from opentopomap is used. Select the area of the map to export as a GeoTiff. Save as a GeoTiff in WGS84 Lat/Lon format. Remember to specify the file name and location for the GeoTiff! The GeoTiff produced can be viewed in OpenCPN using PhotoLayer.

It is the best tool for showing historical data in OpenCPN. The OpenCPN Manual has general information in Plugin Download, Install and Enable. The plugin is designed to monitor speed and course to make the changes to sail sweep obvious. It may be used to better understand the sailing characteristics of a particular sailing vessel, or for fine tuning to give optimal results. For example, tightening a vang, adjusting the the traveler or the jib may produce such a slight change that it is difficult to gauge the result. This plugin can make gps speed feedback visible. The predictor line allows setting the sample time for smoother prediction than the builtin predictor. This is especially useful when traveling relatively slowly in areas with large waves. The top histogram is the Speed Screen which offers Speed, PDS10 (Position Determined Speed = 10 seconds) and PDS 60 (60 seconds.) Position Determined Speed PDS finds the speed of the vessel by comparing current position to the position from the past. For example PDS10 (10 seconds) takes the position 10 seconds before and determines the vessel speed by taking the distance from where it was then. This method filters the data, giving a much steadier reading, but also shows a comparison of useful speed traveled rather than the immediate GPS speed. Consider autosteering that is over or under dampened, or the case of large waves, even with an ideal autopilot. This will cause the boat to not travel in a straight line, but in a S curve. The GPS speed with read higher than the PDS position determined speed. While running the plugin right-click on the plugin screen to bring up the Configuration Menu. While using the plugin you an right-click to change various settings on the fly. Time Frame to Display Select a time frame for the Display from 5 minutes to 60 days.

The OpenCPN Manual has general information in Plugin Download, Install and Enable for installing this plugin. The Polar plugin has 4 modes of operation: Data from logbooks: This mode will read from all logbooks found in the logbook/data directory. If enough data points are found, a polar will be created. Data from NMEA: This mode will read data from the NMEA stream and create a Polar from this data. Data from VDR File: This mode will read a given VDR file and will use the NMEA messages in the file to create a Polar. Edit Manual: This mode allows the user to create a Polar manually. It is possible to switch between modes. For instance edit manually a Polar and then switch to Data from NMEA and Start Record. This will add and update the data for the polar. Data will be collected in 5 degree wind directions and 2 knots of windspeed and this information will be saved. The plugin will also interpolate middle steps, eg 6 and 7 degree will be added to the 5 degree step and 8 and 9 will be added to 10 degree step. The windspeed is divided by 2, so column 2 knots hold the speeds from 2 till 3.99 and column 4 knots will hold the speeds 4 till 5.99. etc up to 40 knots. If reading in other polar files polar_pi tries to fill in the wind direction in 5 degree steps with 2 knots of wind similar to the input from NMEA. The same sampling will be used as above. Polar_pi can read badly formatted polar files with lines of all zeros and can save the file out with the zeros removed. Confirm that your Wind and BSP/STW instruments are properly calibrated and that the nmea0183 data stream is working properly with full sentences and good checksum. Confirm that you can record the data. Record Nmea0183 data while sailing in various wind conditions, at a wide range of wind angles, with the same set of sails trimmed properly, preferably with a clean bottom, average weight in the boat, and no current. Make several of these recordings for different sea states and sets of sails and reefing. Using Polar_pi load one of the files. Load Nmea0183 Recorded Data file Open Nmea0183 Recorded Data file Edit the file. You will want to normalize the data and make it regular, by eye. Save the file with a new name, using some version of [Boat-Sails-Conditions].pol Now you can use it in Weather_routing as one of your Polar files. Note that in Weather__routing you can load multiple polar files such as: Very light wind under power Light to medium wind under mainsail and genoa Heavy wind under mainsail and jib, etc. This plugin does an excellent job of building and preparing polars for use in Weather Routing Plugin.

In our experience, to implement a new radar you need to have three items at the the same time and place: A radar of the desired type with the means to control it such as a chart-plotter. A software developer with at least some C++ skills. They don’t need to be huge, as long as (s)he has the willingness to learn. Lots of time to test, learn, adapt, recycle of #2. We did the first implementation for the Navico Halo (very similar to the 4G) without the radar immediately available, with someone very helpful and responsive. But still, it is a slow and difficult process, also for the tester with the radar. He is loading version after version, returning log files and wireshark files time after time. As a developer you have a turnaround time of hours or days, instead of minutes for a single test. And remember that we are not programming from a specification, there is a lot of trial and error to specify the interface with the radar on the fly. Well, if you’ve done any software development in the last 15 years, you should be able to contribute. We’re here to help you with tips and support. Once you’ve got the hardware running with a computer running OpenCPN, you will start by analysing the commands that your chartplotter produces and the data that comes from your radar. Luckily, all radars seem to send out spokes in the same sort of format, unencrypted and un-authenticated. To do the analysis you will need tools such as tcpdump and wireshark. Focus on simple things first: starting transmission, stopping transmission. Receiving spoke data. Once you’ve got some idea what data goes back and forth, clone the radar_pi project and add files for your own radar type. It’s probably easiest to assess which existing radar looks the most like yours in terms of functionality, and then copy the files for that radar and modify them to your radar. In principle you only need to implement the actual sending of commands and the actual reception of radar data, and even those you don’t need to start from scratch but can probably copy an existing one. You will also need to extend the list of radars and the type of commands it supports, again see how this is done for existing radars. You do not need to code the difficult bits, such as programming the PPI displays, overlay, menu entries, menu boxes, guard zones, target trails, etc. This is all generic code that you will just get for `free'. Once you’ve started you should start sending us pull requests so that we can share your work with others with the same radar.

All you need is a wired Ethernet connection. You can add as many computers as desired, the system will allow operation from all connected MFDs (plotters) and computers. Note: Unlike the older GRadar plugin, the new common plugin does not distinguish between slave and master mode. You can always control the radar from both an (optional) chartplotter and the OpenCPN computer(s). If you already have a Garmin MFD installed the installation consists of: Installing an Ethernet switch, or a WiFi router with a built in Ethernet switch. You need a wired port for each device – the radar, the MFD(s) and the computer running OpenCPN. Connect all devices to the switch. You cannot connect the computer to the auxiliary ethernet ports on the scanner, and possibly also not if the chartplotter has multiple Ethernet ports – the latter is untested. IMPORTANT NOTE: If you do not use a Garmin Ethernet switch, you will need to bypass pin 5 on all ethernet ports connected to a Garmin device. The Garmin devices use pin 5 as a power up signal when it is shorted to ground (the shield of the ethernet cable.) A typical installation with a generic switch would look like this: When there is no Garmin chartplotter involved, you can make a direct connection between the computer and the scanner, but in this case it is imperative that you make pin 5 switchable to power up the scanner. An example configuration could look like this: A convenient method to access the Ethernet radar scanner power control pin (Pin5) is to use a Female-­Female Ethernet adapter plug. A readily available commercial adapter is recommended, such as the Amphenol MRJ­5780­01 adapter. This particular component contains a small PC board which allows easy access to the individual Ethernet cable pins for bypass jumper and switch attachment. Amphenol MRJ-5780-01 and a mounting example. An example supplier is Digikey: Digikey Amphenol MRJ-5780-01 adapter The Garmin radars and chartplotters all use automatic or static IP addresses (without a DHCP server) in the range 172.16.1.0 with netmask 255.255.240.0. The plugin will not work, and actively complain, if it cannot find an ethernet card with an address in this range. The recommended way to use the radar is to use a dedicated ethernet port that is assigned the following data: IP address: 172.16.1.1 Netmask: 255.255.240.0 It does not need a router or DNS address. If you share the ethernet port that you use for the radar with other uses, for instance to connect to a router that connects you to the internet, this is still possible but is a little more complex. This involves adding an alias port, which allows a single physical ethernet card to have multiple IP addresses. With Linux, you can do this as follows: $ sudo ifconfig eth1:1 172.16.1.1 netmask 255.255.240.0 up where eth1 will vary with your hardware. If you want to set this permanently, this is possible as well. Check your OS manual for more details, but if your OS supports the /etc/network/interfaces file you can add the following stanza: auto eth1:1 iface eth1:1 inet static name Garmin special address 172.16.1.1 netmask 255.255.240.0 This configuration system used to be almost ubiquitous, but recent Linux versions may also use SystemD for networking in which case the setup is different (and not explained here yet.) In Microsoft Windows, it is also possible to setup alias IP addresses. For example, in Windows you may select Network Adapter ­> Properties­ > TCP/IP­/IPv4 > Properties­ > Advanced.

All you need is a wired Ethernet connection. You can add as many computers as desired, the system will allow operation from all connected MFDs (plotters) and computers. In all Broadband installation packages (except Lowrance 3G USA) the scanner also ships with a small black box – either a RI10 with NMEA 2000 input or a RI11 with NMEA 0183. It uses the data from the heading sensor on the NMEA network to add this to the radar data. The Navico plotters require heading input to the RI-10/11 for MARPA operation. The plugin uses this heading as the \"best\" source of heading for radar overlay. This box also helps isolating the system electrically, and will improve protection of the computer from damage in case of electrical storms (lightning.) Note that this box is no longer needed with HALO radomes. HALO 4/6/8 apparently come with an interface box, but they don’t inject heading we think. If you already have a Navico MFD installed the installation consists of: Installing an Ethernet switch, or a WiFi router with a built in Ethernet switch. You need a wired port for each device – the radar, the MFD(s) and the computer running OpenCPN. Connect all devices to the switch. For HALO radars which come with a RJ45 at the end of the radar cable and a RJ45 to Yellow Navico converter cable, you can plug the radar cable into a standard switch directly, and use a standard RJ45 patch cable to connect the converter cable to the switch as well. If your radar did not come with a RJ45 to Navico radar connector cable, like the 3G or 4G, you can either buy one or make yourself. The cheapest solution is to cut Navico Ethernet cables with two yellow connectors at both ends, and crimp a RJ45 connector onto both halves. Follow the instructions here to fabricate these: http://yachtelectronics.blogspot.nl/2010/05/lowrance-yellow-ethernet-cabling.html. So for the case where you have a single MFD connected to a 3G/4G radar scanner: Cut the ethernet cable between MFD and scanner. Crimp on two RJ45 connectors. Insert these into a switch. Connect the computer to the switch as well. If your scanner came with a RI10: Cut the supplied Navico ethernet cable in half. Crimp on a RJ45 connector. Insert the RJ45 connector into the computer’s Ethernet port or a standard Ethernet switch and the other side into the RI10. Install the scanner as detailed in the Navico installation instructions. If you bought a HALO or USA Lowrance 3G scanner: Insert the RJ45 connector from the radar scanner into a standard 100 Mbit switch. We recommend always using an ethernet switch in this setup to provide further electrical isolation between the scanner and the computer – this makes your computer safer in case of lightning. If you connect the computer directly to the radar scanner it will work but you have a higher chance of lightning ruining your computer. The scanner and the displays communicate using a system called multicast. This has the advantage that the data only needs to be sent once, and is received by all displays. Uniquely, it also means that there is no issue with IP addresses, so there is no reliance on DHCP working. Any IP address is acceptable for all Navico radars. If you are going to use a switch you may as well use a Gigabit switch. The scanner has a 100 Mbit interface, but a Gigabit switch will use slightly less power than a 100 MBit switch. You should probably also use one that has a 12V input which can be powered directly from the 12V house battery (or a DC/DC converter if you have a 24 V house battery bank.) The author uses a 5 port Netgear GS105 which according to Netgear: Both GS105 and GS108 support the latest Energy E cient Ethernet (IEEE 802.3az) standard, which reduces energy consumption when there is light traffic on an active port or when there is no link or no activity detected. It can further save energy when a short cable (<100m) is used. Energy savings lead directly to cost savings in operation. Note: make sure you get the metal cased GS105/GS108 that uses 12 V input. There are now also other models with a plastic case that have a 5 V input, which requires an extra DC/DC converter. The multicast transmission system used by the scanner means that transmission over WiFi must happen at the lowest rate that any device connected to the WiFi network is capable of. For 802.11b and g this rate is 1 Mbit/s. Since the radar data is \\~1 Mbit/s as well this means it does not work well at all. The solution is to either: * Modify the base rate to be higher. This reduces the maximum range of your WiFi network for all devices. * Get a faster WiFi network, for example 802.11a or 802.1ac (5 GHz). This has a much faster base rate (6 Mbit/s). Unfortunately, most WiFi routers do not allow you to change the base rate. If yours is Linux based and uses \"hostapd\" you can try the following procedure. Edit the following section in \"hostapd.conf\". The example should disable basic rates 10 and 20 (= 1 and 2 Mbit/s): #Basic rate set configuration #List of rates (in 100 kbps) that are included in the basic rate set. #If this item is not included, usually reasonable default set is used. #basic_rates=10 20 #basic_rates=10 20 55 110 #basic_rates=55 110 #basic_rates=60 120 240 The author has had no success with trying the above as the hostapd he is using seems to ignore these instructions, and has resorted to using a 5 GHz network instead. Even that gets seriously loaded by broadcast traffic generated by the Navico MFDs.

Otherwise it toggles the radar windows and overlay off (hidden) or on (shown). Hiding all radar windows and overlay is useful if you are sailing into a highly complex situation where you want full view of the chart display and not have the distraction of radar windows and paints over your charts. The radar keeps its current settings (it keeps transmitting if this was on) until you un-hide (show) it again. There are also entries in the context menu for the radar plugin. The context menu is usually accessed by clicking the right mouse button on the chart window. These are: Hide radar Show radar Radar control… Hide or Show radar should be self-explanatory. If chart overlay is enabled the Radar control… button will show the control menu for that radar only. If chart overlay is disabled it will show the control menu(s) for one or two radars. Up to four classic radar displays, known as Position Plot Indicators (PPI) by professionals, can be shown. You can hide these if so desired (which makes sense only if you enabled the overlay over the chart). You can resize, move or dock them into the chart display. To close them you use the default OS button on the top of the window. To dock or undock them, open the radar control menu and select Windows > Float/Dock PPI . The author likes to use two radar ranges with the windows docked on the right side of the display, one above the other. But just try it out to see what you like best. The PPI window has a Menu button that accesses the control menu. If you moved the PPI window since the last time you accessed the control menu the menu will come up immediately above the Menu button on the PPI window. Every radar has its own control menu. If radar overlay is enabled and you have hidden the control menu of the radar assigned to radar overlay, press the toolbar icon to access the control menu. If all else fails you can access this using the context menu on the chart display (Right mouse button > Radar control …) The control menu only shows those options which are functional for the particular state of the radar, and has various sub-menus. When the radar is not transmitting the menu looks like this: Button Possible values Purpose Adjust Change basic settings such as range, gain, clutter Advanced Change advanced settings View Picture orientation and trails Cursor Information and settings driven by the cursor Guard zones Controlling the guard zones Window How the PPI or overlay is displayed Timed transmit Schedule radar transmission Start/Stop radar Standby, Transmitting, Timed state Toggle radar transmit state Note: Your radar may not support all shown items, in which case they are not shown in the menu. Note: Unlike earlier releases, all menu items that your radar supports are always shown. If they cannot be enabled they are shown greyed out. This allows you to set radar gain, sea clutter, rain clutter and range. Range can be set to Auto if the radar picture is overlayed on the chart. Depending on your radar type several auto modes are possible for sea clutter. The advanced settings allows other settings to be modified. These are radar specific. You can also go even deeper to the Installation menu, which allows modification of radar settings such as the heading correction and mount height. The view menu allows modification of how the radar picture is viewed. You can set the orientation and center of the radar picture in the PPI window. You can also change the refresh rate; if you want a continuously sweeping update increase the refresh rate. If your computer cannot keep up with the radar picture (high CPU or GPU load) or you are using a remote viewer such as VNC you can lower the refresh rate. The target trails options will make radar targets linger on the screen, shown in a white-grey palette. Target trails are especially useful if your radar is having trouble with reliable target detection. It can also be used as a poor-mans doppler effect: if the radar heading stabilization would be perfect, only moving targets will show a large trail. You can switch between true and relative trails. The latter shows the target’s motion relative your own course and speed. You can also modify whether AIS and ARPA triangles are shown on the PPI windows. Lastly, for HALO radars that support it we can enable the Doppler mode built into these radars; with Doppler the radar will show clearly (in yellow) which targets are moving more than 3 knots towards or away from the radar. The PPI windows will always show where the cursor on the main chart window is in blue, and if you click on the chart or PPI window this position will be marked with a white cursor. The cursor menu will allow you to use this white cursor mark. You can either use it as an EBL/VRM mark, which shows an Electronic Bearing Line (EBL) with a range ring (Virtual Range Mark). The EBL/VRM can be used as a \"memory\" so that you can compare the current position of a target with an earlier position and range. The other use is that you can have the radar acquire a target that is at or near the cursor location. This is called MARPA - Mini Automatic Radar Plotting Aid. If the MARPA target is seen another 2 revolutions of the scanner it will be converted into an AIS-like target that is shown both on the PPI window (if enabled on the View menu) and the chart displays. The plugin supports 50 (M)ARPA targets. See Guard Zones below for ARPA. You can define two guard zones where, if targets are seen in that sector of the radar, they will either sound an alarm and/or be converted into an ARPA target. Which option you prefer is dependent on what sort of environment you are sailing in; in congested waters it may be advantageous to use the ARPA facility for a guard zone that extends ahead of the boat. This way boats without an AIS will automatically be converted over to ARPA targets. If you choose to have the guard zones raise an alarm you will see an alarm dialog box and a voice over saying ``Alarm: Targets detected''. If you confirm the alarm it will not be raised until the targets have disappeared from the guard zone and re-appear. Via the window menu you can choose whether the PPI window is shown and whether the radar picture should be overlayed over the chart window. For the latter to be enabled you need GNSS position and heading (or COG, see Preferences.) You can also dock the PPI window. This means that the PPI window is not shown as a separate window, but shown on the right side of the chart(s) on the main OpenCPN window. You can also access the Info window which will show automatically if something is wrong or a setting is insufficient. This allows you to check the detected radar type(s) and how many radar spokes are received. Timed transmit is useful for magnetron radars that (a) use a lot of power and (b) have a limited life span. For modern non-magnetron digital radars this is not really useful. It allows you to set both the on time and the standby time of the radar. When activated the status will be shown at the Control menu > Start/Stopp button.

You can choose between two types of drawing the picture; Vertex Array and Shader. Depending on the hardware and OS it is possible that one performs better than the other. Shader will perform the same regardless of how \"busy\" the radar picture is, whereas Vertex Array will use more CPU when there is more to draw. Also, Shader draws a little more \"soft\" image on most devices.

Let’s start with a minimal setup and grow this step by step, and see what functionality is enabled by these steps. It won’t come as a surprise to you that you need a supported radar scanner. If you buy new, we recommend the Navico HALO. It has better definition and more features than the Garmin xHD and the older Navico radars, and we don’t support new Garmin or other brand radars yet. If you buy secondhand make sure the radar is still working. Like all radome antennas they are susceptible to moisture and not all of them will live to be 20 years old! The lifetime of a magnetron is 2000-4000 hours. Digital radars just die of old age. The plugin requires a compass heading to be able to show the radar image in stabilized, COG up or North up mode. If there is no compass heading it will just show the radar image as received from the scanner, and the image will not be correct during turns or heavy sea conditions that induce yaw. The higher the compass rate the better the picture will be in difficult circumstances. With Navico Broadband BR24/3G/4G radars use of an RI-10/11 will improve the picture as well, as the heading in use at the moment of creating the spoke (a ray of radar data in a particular direction) is stored with the data. The plugin requires a GNSS location (usually GPS) to be able to draw the radar image over the chart (overlay). By default it also requires a compass heading, as COG is not useful at low speeds. There is a setting that allows the use of COG for overlay, but it does mean that the radar overlay is not useful at anchor or other zero/low speed situations. Also is the COG affected by leeway and currents and may point sideways leading to a misplaced overlay picture.

OpenGL mode enabled in OpenCPN. If you use Microsoft Windows, you will generally have a firewall, and some Linux systems also have this. As the radars use multicast, it can be hard to setup a firewall rule as you don’t just 'open' a particular port. The simplest solution is to allow opencpn.exe full access to the network for both receive and transmit. If you have issues with radar detection, for Garmin check the IP address, see [[Hardware installation (Garmin)]]. For all radars, disable the firewall, and if it works then try enabling it with an exception for opencpn.exe. Go to the OpenCPN options dialog and on the first pane choose Advanced. Check that the OpenGL option is activated. The OpenGL drawing mechanism uses the GPU to draw graphics instead of the CPU. This is required for the radar plugin as it provides many moving graphics objects. Most computers produced after 2005 have a GPU and operating system that supports OpenGL. Note: If you use a Raspberry Pi 2 or older, performance will be too low. A Raspberry Pi 3 or 4 might work. With the very latest Raspbian and RPi4 it would work but you need to enable OpenGL in OpenCPN. The recent radar_pi plugin version is avaiable in OpenCPN plugin manager. Start OpenCPN Go to Options > Plugins Update the master catalog, or any other desired catalog. Select radar_pi and install a possible update. Click Enabled. The plugin should then show the Radar Selection dialog. If it does not, click Preferences for the Radar plugin on the plugin pane. On the selection dialog choose your radar. If you have a dual range radar and want to view multiple ranges, you can choose both the A and B radars. If you intend to use one of your ranges for the chartplotter and one for OpenCPN so they do not interfere, choose only A or B. Note: If you have a Navico 3G where the firmware date is before Oct 2014 select radar type BR24. Connect and check the firmware status reported in the Info dialog. Close the selection dialog. Close the options dialog. Note: On some operating systems the Radar windows appear frozen and do not react to your input when the Options dialog is open; this is a technical restriction caused by the Options dialog being a modal dialog. Just close the OpenCPN Options dialog and then the radar windows will react again. You should now see one or two Position Plot Indicator or PPI windows floating over your OpenCPN window, and maybe also an Info dialog if your radar has not been detected yet. If the Info dialog shows, watch it carefully for any hints on what is wrong. For instance, in the picture below you see that a Garmin radar was selected but the plugin cannot find an Ethernet interface with the proper network address: Fix the issue(s) mentioned by the Info dialog. If it shows Initializing, it is searching all your Ethernet cards for the radar. Once it succeeds, it remembers on which Ethernet card the radar was found and it will be quicker once OpenCPN restarts. If the radar remains initializing immediately after enabling the plugin, try restarting OpenCPN. The Info dialog shows if: No interface has a proper address (Garmin only) The radar has not been detected yet (all radars send out regular I’m here messages) The OpenGL option has not been selected. Overlay is desired and True Heading or (Magnetic heading plus Variation) is not present Once the Info dialog disappears, the radar has been found and is ready for operation. You now have a another icon in the toolbar. If the radar has not been detected yet it will show as: If the radar has been detected it will show: If the radar is detected but hidden it will show: And if the radar is transmitting it will show: The info window will show whether the scanner has been detected, and whether there is a valid heading input. If a condition is not satisfied this dialog will open automatically. You can also open it using the control menu. As you can see in the Info dialog shows whether you have OpenGL mode enabled. It also shows whether radar presence has been detected, and whether the overlay/heading conditions have been fulfilled. In the above image the radar type and serial numbers are shown, this shows that the radar has been detected successfully. For North Up display and radar overlay you must have a heading sensor attached, either via the RI10/11 (Navico Broadband only, preferred) or via NMEA0183 input to OpenCPN directly. If you use a magnetic sensor the variation is also required, but that is easy to do by enabling the WMM plugin. For radar overlay you must have a boat position via GNSS input to OpenCPN. The most common is a GPS sensor sending NMEA0183 data. By user requests it has been made possible to occasional use Course Over Ground, COG, from your GNSS as the heading input, but this is not enabled by default. (Using compass heading works more securely.) Go to the Options > Plugins > Radar > Preferences page to enable it.

Rotation Control Plugin (RotationCtrl-pi) allows the user to control the way the chart is shown on the the computer-screen. You can rotate the chart manually (clockwise, counterclockwise) and in the following manners: North up (the top of the chart corresponds to the direction of true North). South up (the top of the chart corresponds to the direction of true South). Course up (the top of the chart points corresponds to the direction you are actually goïng (Course over Ground). Heading up (the top of the chart corresponds to the direction you are steering). Route up (the top of the chart corresponds to the waypoint that is activated as “navigate to”. Wind up (the top of the chart corresponds to the direction the wind is coming from). The plugin gets the necessary information in the following ways: about “North“and “South”: from the information in your digital charts. about your course: from your GPS. about your heading: from your (electronic) compass that outputs NMEA-data to OpenCPN. about your route: from OpenCPN (when you have activated a route). about the wind: from your wind sensor that outputs NMEA-data to OpenCPN. Normally the representation of a chart is “North up”. That means Top is “North”, Right hand side is “East”, Bottom is “South” and Left hand side is “West”. But maybe you prefer to have the top of the chart corresponding to “South”. Or to have the top of the chart corresponding to: your present course (to where you are really going to) or heading (to the direction your bow is pointing to) or route (to where you are supposed to go) or the wind-direction (the direction to avoid facing while throwing up or peeing). Examples: This sailing vessel is inward bound. The representation is “North up”. The wind (blue arrow) is from the West. The ship’s heading is the red dashed line. The ships course (over the ground) is the white dotted line. The ships route (next active waypoint) is the red dot at the end of the green line (and don’t worry, she’s just about to turn to port). The next illustrations show you the differences. Note the rotation of the coastline. South up Course up Heading up Route up Wind up The OpenCPN Manual has general information in Plugin Download, Install and Enable for installing this plugin. This is the preferred way. Rotation-pi can also be downloaded from https://opencpn.org/OpenCPN/info/downloadplugins.html and installed with a Legacy Pl Package. Don’t forget to enable the plugin. The Rotation-pi icons should appear in your Toolbar. Additionally you can set the Preferences. What are basic (standard) actions you have to do to make Rotation-pi work. Simple: just click the button of your choice to activate the desired rotation. Note: the buttons for “Manual Tilt” (the red buttons) do not seem to work yet! To go back to the normal representation (“North up”) click the “North up”-button. This is the “normal” representation (“North up”). We are sailing in a narrow channel in a southerly direction. On the chart, the coast is on the left side of the boat-icon. But for the helmsman on board the coast is on his right hand (starboard) side. For someone who has a clear visual image of the chart “in his head”, this should not be a problem. But other people may find it a bit confusing. This is the same situation, but now with “Heading up”. In this presentation-mode the chart shows the coast on the same side (right hand) as it is seen from the helmsman’s position. That sounds logical. But for those of us who have “the chart in their head” it can be confusing. (because the brain may say “Hey skipper! It’s your boat that is moving and turning, not the coast!”) Let’s face it: when thinking of the UK and Ireland,is this what you have in mind? When using ENC-charts (vector-charts) you might experience some weird behavior when using any other mode than “North up”. This is “North up” Note the ENC-text for the names and numbers of the buoys and the indication “Wk” on the wreck-symbols. And a few seconds later, but now with “Heading up”. Note the icons for the buoys are not “upright” anymore, but also rotated (and with “South up” they would be completely upside down). But more disturbing is that the ENC text for the names and numbers of the buoys has disappeared (as has the text “Wk” on the wreck-symbols). And other ENC-text might be placed in the wrong positions. This “missing text-bug” can occur because in this example a ENC (a vector chart) is used. It can occur with all representations that are not “North up”. Note: This does not seem to occur to all ENC’s, but it can occur. It can not happen while using a raster chart (on a raster chart you will not lose the text, but the text will be rotated the same way as the rest of the information on that chart). When used in conjunction with the Google Earth-plugin, something strange happens. In any representation-mode other than “North-up” or “South-up”, the picture in the Google Earth-window rotates opposite to the rotation of the main screen (the chart). In other words, if the main charts rotates clockwise, the Google Earth-window rotates counter-clockwise and vice versa. True, it does make navigation more interesting, but nevertheless should be considered a bug in this When you alter course, something happens on your OpenCPN screen. In normal mode (“North up”) OpenCPN rotates your ship’s icon. But in modes “Heading up”, “Course up” and “Route up”, you want OpenCPN to rotate the world. That takes a lot more than just rotating that ship-icon. On less powerful systems it might cause the system to respond slower than desired (or it might cause other problems).","title":"Rotation Control","component":"rotationctrl","version":"","name":"index","url":"/rotationctrl/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Links","hash":"_links","id":1},{"text":"1.

The advantage of a great circle is obvious, the shorter distance. The disadvantages, depending on latitude, could be quite a few. Colder weather, stronger winds, higher seas and perhaps even icebergs. The great circle is just one factor in the decision making, when planning a route, the weather is likely to be the deciding factor in most cases. OpenCPN has a builtin Great Circle tool as well as a Great Circle plugin. The built in Great Circle tool. The “Measure” tool in the right-click menu and the “Create Route” button on the ToolBar switches seamlessly to a great circle mode when asked to do long distance tasks. This mainly happens when using these tools in some east-west direction and far away from the equator. The mode kicks in when the difference between the normal, rhumb line and the great circle becomes larger than two nautical miles. This will be some 0.2% to 0.5% of the total distance, depending on latitude and direction. When this happens a clear curve towards the pole will appear. The Measure Tool Testing the measure tool for Manila to San Francisco (approximately). For a good illustration to Great circles, find a second point that is opposite the first, on the other side of the globe, and just move around slightly. Once the first leg in measuring is done, it’s plotted as a rhumb-line, to keep things simple. The active leg is still displayed as a great circle, if long enough. The distance displayed is the combined great circle distances. image::route.png[image,width=32,height=32] The “Create Route” Tool If you answer no to the above question, OpenCPN will use a traditional rhumb line for the leg. Answering yes, will kick the great circle option into action and a number of intermediate waypoints will be created. There will be at least 3 waypoints. The exact number of waypoints is calculated by OpenCPN and is appropriate for most cases. The created route is now available in the RouteManager dialog, as a normal route. As a real example let us look at a route from Mossel Baai, South Africa, to the western entrance to Investigator Strait, South Australia. The rhumb line is 5660 nautilcal miles, and the great circle, as approximated by the created route is 5249 miles. The “real” great circle is some 15 miles shorter. Composite Saling Composite sailing is a great circle sailing with a maximum allowed latitude. OpenCPN has no such built-in option, but it’s easy to create. Above is the same route as before designed for composite sailing, not going further south than 45° S latitude. Start a route at Mossel Baai extend it until 45° S becomes a tangent to the visible great circle. End the route. Do the same thing, starting with the destination and going backwards. Create a rhumb line route, using the two points along 45° S. The three routes together form the composite route. The total distance of the composite route is 5293 Nautical Miles. “Salty Paws” route plugin handles much more than great circles, introduced here. The plugin has a few features not present in the built-in tool. It can calculate a composite route, and the distance between the waypoints can be set by the user.

I cut the antenna coax included with the dongle, and spliced it to the vhf coax. You must solder both inner and outer (shield) connections. You must now compile rtl-sdr from source: git clone git://git.osmocom.org/rtl-sdr.git mkdir build cd build cmake .. sudo make install Next, you must have either aisdecoder or gnuradio (with gr-ais).

The receiver program (rtl_fm) and decoder (aisdecoder) are included as pre-built binaries, so from here, install the plugin setup package. So far I have no pre-built packages for gnuradio on windows, but this would be useful if provided. If there are issues it may be helpful to install the sdrsharp program to determine if the dongle is receiving data at all. It should be possible (from the preferences dialog) to calibrate the dongle with the Auto Calibrate button: From what I can tell so far, the error correction range is +- 128 (my two dongles use values of 35 and 50) and must be within 5 for aisdecoder and 15-20 for gnuradio. When the value is more accurate, more ais messages are received as well. From here, install the plugin package, or build from source and install. This works best in an area with a lot of ais traffic.

These charts are quite reasonably priced….S-63 is the encrypted distribution format for S-57 vector charts. Today, hydrographical offices all over the world are producing their official vector charts in the S-57 format. Distribution is done under the S-63 standard. To use the encrypted charts, you must get a license for your particular machine (called Permit), make sure to visit http://o-charts.org/ for more information and to get the permits. S63 is an encrypted version of S57 vector charts, and is the standard format for almost all, officially published, vector charts in today’s world. As a matter of fact, only NOAA and the East Asia Hydrographic Commission (EAHC), publishes free unencrypted S57 charts nowadays. These, S57 and S63 charts, are the current state of the art charts. The quality of the charts are the best vector charts available. They are always kept up to date. No other vector chart are in the same league. There are, however also some drawbacks. Many popular cruising areas are very poorly covered as the focus is on the needs for commercial shipping. One example is he Bahamas area. Another problem is the relatively high price. When licensing consider the licensing period. Your charts will be available still after expiring just without weekly updates. OpenCPN handles these commercial, non free, charts through an open source plugin, that in the background connects to a “black box” helper application. An external entity, http://o-charts.org, handles the encrypted and commercial aspects of the S-63 plug-ins for OpenCPN. Download the plugin for your operating system the official OpenCPN download page. Also download and read the informative Documentation from https://manuals.o-charts.org/. Really!! Install the plugin the way you normally install programs on your operating system. The S-63 plug-in gets enabled at installation. Check that your Options→Charts shows a new “S63 Charts” tab, as in the pictures below. At the S-63 Keys/Permit tab you can create a system identifier file which “fingerprints” your individual system - a file you will need for the InstallPermit. Try this on your system before licensing charts to ensure that a fingerprint can be created for you. Now go to the O-charts shop to get your “User Permit” and “Install Permit”. Use these to license your chart selection. Detailed instructions are available on o-charts.org The Keys/Permits tab. Certificate Name This should already be present after a sucessfull plugin installation. If it’s missing press the “Import Certificate…” button and import the file IHO.PUB. To find the location of this, file press the image::help.png[image] button in the toolbar. Find the “Config file location” at the bottom of the “About” tab. Go to the same directory as the config file, and then to the s63→s63_certificates directory, where you will find IHO.PUB. UserPermit Enter your new Userpermit from O-charts and test it. The permit above is from IHO’s test suit and is not valid in real life. New InstallPermit Enter your new Installpermit from O-charts and test it. OpenCPN is now setup for S63 charts. Lincense your charts or use the test set. See instructions below. Download and uncompress your files. Install Cell Permits by using the button “Import Cell Permits…” to find the file PERMIT.TXT.

It connects to a multiplayer sailing simulator/game on the Internet. Highly realistic. Over 9000 players so far. The basic edition is free! SailawayNMEA uses the API offered by 'Sailaway' to provide a JSON feed from that program to OpenCPN. The JSON is then read and the NMEA sentences produced fed to OpenCPN. An Internet connection is needed to load the boat data and provide the feed. After registering, playing and without running the Sailaway game you have 7 days where you can still obtain a feed, which could be useful for testing NMEA work. You need to have registered with Sailaway, chosen a boat and started sailing to provide a feed to OpenCPN. It is best to start sailing at minumum speed! Registration gives you a user name which is used to load the boats you are sailing. The OpenCPN program should be closed before starting the installation. Double-click on the installer '.exe' file. Follow the steps and finish installing. Start OpenCPN and select Options→Plugins from the toolbar. Enable the SailawayNMEA plugin. This will place the Sailaway button on the toolbar. Click the plugin button and the dialog will open. The plugin uses UDP to feed the data to OpenCPN. The connection to the Sailaway server is via TCP/IP. Default ports are 57343 for UDP and 10110 for TCP/IP. Set them up as shown here: Enter your user name. Press 'Enter' or the button 'Load Boats' to download the boats you have chosen in Sailaway from the server. It is useful to open Dashboard to see the data. To avoid creating excessive load on the Sailaway server the sailing data is only downloaded every 10 minutes.This is at the request of the developer of Sailaway. To provide a continuous NMEA feed DR positions are calculated. You can disable this but performance will be impacted. Press the 'Start Server' button to start the feed of sailing data.

SAR_pi (SAR = Search And Rescue) SAR_pi is a plugin that can generate different types of Search and Rescue search patterns directly from within OpenCPN. You can save these patterns as GPX files. These GPX files can then be loaded in OpenCPN and used as routes to follow in order to perform an efficiënt search and rescue operation. Note: In this document “Search And Rescue will be shortened to “SAR”. When a SAR operation is necessary, there is absolutely no time to lose. It can be a fellow sailor who is in distress, or a loved-one who fell overboard during a dark and rough night. It is very important that your search operation is as efficiënt as possible. Meaning that with the required speed you cover a maximum of the search-area in a minimum of time. In order to achieve that, it is best to follow certain patterns. These search-patterns have proven to give the best results for certain conditions. When the need arises, you can start thinking about making a search pattern. And then you have to actually lay out that pattern as a track or route to follow. But that will take you some time and it requires clear thinking. And especially in those situations “clear thinking” is challenged by a lot of other worries on your mind. Let SAR_pi do the work for you! Note: in most circumstances SAR operations are coördinated by the Coast Guard or other professional search and rescue-organisations. These operations are coordinated and executed by highly trained specialists and follow specific rules and procedures. This manual is meant primarily for situations where you are on your own and you are the first (or only) ship in the vicinity. There is no time to lose, so choose a search pattern that is best suited for the situation. In short: to search a large area when the location of the search object is uncertain. when the location of the search object is known within relatively close limits; when searching for persons in the water or other search objects with little or no leeway. (but keep in mind: this procedure is less suited to be used simultaneously by multiple vessels) when the position of the search object is accurately known and the search area is small. (but keep in mind: this procedure is less suited to be used simultaneously by multiple vessels) when you want to search just one quadrant relative to a fixed position. Important: Consider the sea conditions, visibility, target type, drift and speed of the searching vessel when deciding both the search pattern type and the spacing used for the pattern. Nobody is eager to get involved in a situation that necessitates a SAR-operation. Not as the object that has to be found and not as a vessel that participates in the SAR-operation. But if you do, you will have to understand that one of the keys to a successful operation is coordination and the avoidance of miscommunication. That involves understanding some specific terms and abbreviations. SRU: Search and Rescue Unit (for instance: your ship). Search speed: This is the speed of the searching ship. Note: the higher the speed, the greater the distance you can cover in a given time. But high speed might also result in a bigger risk of passing the position of the searched object without noticing that object. Search Area: the area most likely to contain the search object. Datum: the Datum is the most probable location of a search object, corrected for movement over time (drift). So that’s the place we would normally begin our search. Search Leg: a Search Leg is the long leg of a parallel search pattern. Cross Leg: a Cross Leg is a connection between two search legs of a parallel search pattern. Sweep Width: the distance an SRU should be able to detect the search object on either side of the leg. Sweep Width will be affected by the height of the observer and the weather-conditions. A clear day and calm sea will give a larger Sweep Width than a stormy night. type or size of the target, A distressed vessel will be easier to see than a head in the water. Leg Spacing: the distance between two parallel Search Legs. That distance should be no more than 2x Sweep Width. RCC: Rescue coordination centre: A unit responsible for promoting efficient organization of search and rescue services and for coordinating the conduct of search and rescue operations within a search and rescue region.The RCC normally assigns a SMC. SMC: SAR Mission Coordinator: The official temporarily assigned to coordinate response to an actual or apparent distress situation. The SMC can assign an OSC. OSC: On-scene coordinator: A person designated to coordinate search and rescue operations within a specified area. CSP: Commence Search Point: Point, normally specified by the SMC, where a SRU is to begin its search pattern. When two or more SRU’s are working together on the same mission, one person on scene may be needed to coordinate the activities of all participating SRU’s. The person in charge of the first SRU to arrive at the scene will normally assume the OSC function until the SMC arranges for that person to be relieved. The OSC is normally a person in charge of a: ship or aircraft participating in a search, or nearby facility in a position to handle OSC duties. When a SRU arrives on-scene in advance of the others, it should proceed directly to datum and commence an expanding square search. If possible, datum may be marked by putting over a liferaft or other floating marker with a leeway similar to that of the search object, as a check on the drift. This can then be used as a datum marker throughout the search. As other SRU’s arrive, the OSC should select one of the search patterns, as appropriate, and allocate search sub-areas to individual SRU’s. In good visibility and with sufficient SRU’s, the OSC may let the first SRU continue its expanding square search while the others conduct a parallel track search through the same area. In restricted visibility, or if sufficient SRU’s are not available, it will probably be better to have the first SRU break off the expanding square search and be available for initiation of a parallel track search. Search patterns are for the “S”-part of SAR. But let’s not forget the “R”-part (after all, that “R”-part is the one and only reason for the “S”-part). So prepare yourself to do what has to be done once the search proves succesful. That will probably be: assisting distressed craft and/or recovering people from survival-craft or from the water. Be aware of drift! Precise search pattern navigation using high-precision methods such as GPS-systems will produce good patterns relative to the ocean bottom, but not relative to the drifting search object. This could allow the search object to drift out of the search area. Therefore the currents and other forces affecting the search object’s drift during the search should be taken into careful consideration. If a smoke float or other highly visible, expendable object is available, it should be deployed at datum and the pattern should be performed relative to it. Be aware of the risks involved! Vessels proceeding to assist should assess the risks they may encounter on scene, including the risks such as those associated with leaking cargo, etc. Information should be sought as necessary from the distressed craft and/or from the RCC or, if no RCC is involved, the OSC. Now you’re ready to read on…. Note: In this section the instructions are specifically for SAR_pi, but there is a dedicated page in the User Manual with information about Downloading, Installing and Enabling Plugins in general. The plugin is \"managed\" and is installed with the plugin manager. Before you can actually use the plugin, you first have to enable that plug-in in OpenCPN. Enabling the plugin in OpenCPN. Open (or restart) OpenCPN. Click Tools-Options-Plugins. Scroll down untill you see the SAR. Click “Enabled”. Now the SAR_pi icon should appear somewhere in your OpenCPN Toolbar. The ability to quickly deploy efficient search and rescue patterns is relevant since no matter how developed our means of transportation may get, the possibility of an emergency arising due to an accident or other reasons can never be ruled out. Specific SAR patterns have been worked out to deal with maritime emergencies. These various search and rescue patterns will be explained below. Types of Search and Rescue Patterns SAR_pi can generate 4 different types of search patterns. They are: Parallel Track Expanding Square Sector Search Oil Rig (Quadrant Single) In the section “Operation” we will explain the patterns in some more detail. Standard Actions Click the SAR icon in the Toolbar Choose the desired search pattern. In this example: Parallel Track The plugin has a window with two sections: the top half and the bottom half. Here you can set the type of search-pattern. The initial pattern is the type “Parallel Track”. In each search pattern you can enter several parameters, for instance the search speed. They will be explained in more detail in the specific section for each type of pattern There are also buttons to calculate the distance and time of the search pattern and to generate a GPX file for that pattern. But before you generate the GPX file, go to the bottom half of the window. The bottom half of the window is for entering the start-position of the search pattern and for showing the results (the distance of the calculated search pattern and the time it will take to complete that pattern). When the parameters for the search-pattern are entered, you can click “Calculate”. In the case of the Parallel Track search the Commence Search Point (CSP) is not the datum. The CSP must be chosen to optimise the outcome of the search, based on likely drift and time since the casualty was reported. A warning message advises that the CSP is being used. and find out that (in this example) the pattern will cover 41 NM and will take 8.2 hours to complete. If you want the search pattern to start at your ship’s position and the GPS is feeding OpenCPN with that information, you go to the bottom half of the window and click “Ship”. You can also use the position of your cursor on the screen. For instance when you are still some distance away from the area where the search has to take place. A message will pop up to tell you to move the cursor to the position on the chart and press Ctrl-S. A third option is to enter latitude and longitude of the starting position by hand. For example: you hear a MAYDAY of a ship that is sinking in position 33 degrees 46.5 minutes North / 068 degrees 51.5 minutes West. Fill in the position and click “Convert to degree”. The final option is to use 'Right-Click' on the position for the Datum Point/CSP. Use the option 'Select SAR Datum Point' to transfer that position to the dialog. Now click “Generate GPX”. We save the file in a folder where we can easily find it. For instance in the folder “SAR”. Abbreviations are used professionally for the different search patterns. The plugin tries to reflect these, not only in the default GPX file names but also in the routes that appear when imported into OpenCPN. PS Parallel Track search with a single unit. SS Expanding Square (Square Search) VS Sector Search (Vector Search) QS Oil Rig (Quadrant Search) Go in the OpenCPN Toolbar to “Route & Mark Manager” and import the GPX-file as a route. The search pattern will show up as a new route. Make sure it is “visible” (the “eye” should be open). You can inspect the properties of the route. If you have upgraded to OpenCPN 5.2 the speed you choose for the search will be used for the route calculations. For OpenCPN 5.0 you need to enter the speed and update the route properties. The standard actions can be summed up as: Choose the desired search pattern “Parallel Track”, “Expanding Square”, “Sector Search” or “Oil Rig (Quadrant Single)”. Enter the parameters. Click “Calculate” to find out how long the search track will be in nautical miles and how long it will take you to complete that search. Click “Generate GPX” to generate a GPX file of the search pattern. Open “Route and Mark Manager” In the “Route” tab, Click “Import GPX” Find the GPX-file you just generated and click “OK”. The search pattern will appear on your screen and can be used as a route. Keywords: LARGE AREA POSITION OF SEARCH OBJECT APPROXIMATE UNIFORM COVERAGE DESIRED SEARCH LEGS PARALLEL Parallel Track Search: is used to search a large area when survivor location is uncertain. is usually used when a large search area must be divided into sub-areas for assignment to individual SRU’s on-scene at the same time. has search legs with their longest side oriented true north or, when drift has to be considered, oriented in the direction of the drift line. can be undertaken with one or more vessels (preferably with at least two ships). Risk with restricted visibility A parallel track search in restricted visibility poses problems because of the following considerations: desirability of reducing the interval between SRU’s as much as possible consistent with safety resulting loss of search area coverage; potential risk of collision Click the SAR icon in the Toolbar Choose the desired search pattern. In this case: Parallel Track. We have already seen the first parallel track search pattern in Standard actions. This was made using the default 'Starboard' button. It is for one unit and the first turn of the pattern is to starboard. We can choose to make the first turn to port. If two units are available we can generate the patterns for the two units as separate routes in a single GPX file. For the first turn “Starboard” selection the following parameters were used: Initial leg course = 030 degrees Search Leg length = 3 NM Track Space = 0.5 NM Number of Legs = 4 Search Speed = 5 knots “Initial leg course” The Initial leg course is the direction you want the “legs” to point. Normally this will be at 90 degrees to the direction of the drift or, if no drift has to be taken into account, true north. In the following example we have entered 030 degrees (roughly Nort-East). “Search Leg length” This is the length in nautical miles of each leg. “Track space” This is the distance in nautical miles between two (parallel) legs. Note: when the lookout is positioned high above the water, for instance in a crow’s nest, the lookout has a better view and can see object further away than when he would be positioned low above the water. In such cases the distance between the legs can be greater than when the lookout is low above the water. See also the explanation of “Sweep Width”. “Number of legs” This the number of legs you want to use in the search pattern. The higher the number, the more legs and the longer the search pattern. “Search speed” This is the speed of the searching ship. Note: the higher the speed, the greater the distance you can cover in a given time. But high speed might also result in a bigger risk of passing the position of the searched object without noticing that object. We use the position of our cursor as the starting point (as described under “Standard Actions”), Back in the top half of the window we click “Generate GPX” and save the GPX-file (as described under “Standard Actions”) In OpenCPN we open the GPX-file as a route (as described under “Standard Actions”) and this is the result. The pattern has 4 legs, 0.5 nm apart from each other and the first leg is orientated in the direction 030. Activate the route and start your SAR operation! Note: in these screenshots the “own ship” icon is pointing upwards (away from the starting-point). There is no GPS feed. If there are two ships participating in the search, you use the option “2 units A&B”. We assume the “mothership” launches her (faster) RIB. Repeat the process of creating the GPX file, saving it and opening it as a route in OpenCPN. This is the result with both of the routes shown. The search-pattern for ship B is the route coloured red. Let us assume that ship B is a RIB that can easily cruise at 15 knots. When we look at the two routes PS-AB-1 and PS-AB-2 they initially have the same speed. Using the route manager it is possible to change the planned speed for ship 2 (B) from 5kts to 15kts in order to estimate the time the rib will take on that part of the search. Note: Suppose there are two ships. One is the relatively big and slow but comfortable mother-ship with her well-equipped navigational area (and of course OpenCPN plus SAR-plugin). The other ship is the small and fast but very uncomfortable RIB that’s speeding towards the search-area. Now it is possible to generate the SAR-patterns in the relative comfort of the mother-ship (or even from a shore-based station) and then send the generated GPX-file(s) via email to one or more other ships. Like that RIB. There that GPX-file can be received (and used!) on a mobile phone that has OpenCPN for Android! Go in the OpenCPN Toolbar to “Route & Mark Manager” and import the GPX-file as a route. The search pattern will show up as a new route. Make sure it is “visible” (the “eye” should be open). You can inspect the properties of the route. If you have upgraded to OpenCPN 5.2 the speed you choose for the search will be used for the route calculations. For OpenCPN 5.0 you need to enter the speed and update the route properties. The standard actions can be summed up as: Choose the desired search pattern “Parallel Track”, “Expanding Square”, “Sector Search” or “Oil Rig (Quadrant Single)”. Enter the parameters. Click “Calculate” to find out how long the search track will be in nautical miles and how long it will take you to complete that search. Click “Generate GPX” to generate a GPX file of the search pattern. Open “Route and Mark Manager” In the “Route” tab, Click “Import GPX” Find the GPX-file you just generated and click “OK”. The search pattern will appear on your screen and can be used as a route. Keywords: SMALL AREA FIRST SEARCH LEG IS EITHER DIRECTION OF DRIFT OR TRUE NORTH ALL TURNS ARE 90º TO THE RIGHT TRACK SPACING DETERMINES 1ST AND 2ND LEG THEN ADD ONE TRACK SPACING EVERY OTHER LEG Starting at the probable location of the target, the search vessels expand outward in concentric squares. This pattern is the most effective pattern when the location of the search object is known within relatively close limits. The commence search point is always the datum position. The first leg should be in the direction of wind and tide. Expanding square search is often appropriate for vessels or small boats to use when searching for persons in the water or other search objects with little or no leeway. Due to the small area involved, this procedure is less suited to be used simultaneously by multiplevessels. Setting up an \"Expanding Square\" search pattern Click the SAR-icon in the Toolbar Choose the desired search pattern. In this case: Expanding Square. The parameter-window shows these fields: The initial course should be set in the direction of the drift, or else to 000 (true North). The rest should be easy to understand, so we will not explain this further. Following the steps described in “Standard Actions” and using the parameters in the screenshot will give a result that looks like this: Keywords: RELIABLE POSITION OF SEARCH OBJECT SMALL SEARCH AREA DATUM AT CENTER STARTS AND ENDS AT DATUM ALL TURNS ARE 120º TO THE RIGHT 1ST LEG IN DIRECTION OF DRIFT The sector search is employed when the position of the lost ship or lost body is known accurately and the search has to be carried over a small area, say with each leg a length of no more than 2 to 5 NM. It is normally carried out in the area where the casualty or the object has been sighted. The search pattern starts from the Commence Search Point (CSP). The initial course then passes through the datum and should be in the direction of the wind/tide or overall drift. The search pattern starts from the datum point and continues on the initial course. This pattern gives a very high probability of detection close to the datum point and spreads the search over the probable area quickly. With a man overboard, the ship returns immediately to the datum or, if the search target is once sighted and then lost, the ship heads for the datum. All turns are 120 degrees to starboard. Upon completion of the search pattern, re-orient the pattern 30 degrees to the right and search a new pattern (see the dashed lines). The advantage of this pattern is that the search vessels cross the datum a number of times. The first step is to determine the drift and carry out the operations in that direction (first leg in the direction of the drift). A suitable marker (for example, a smoke float or a radio beacon) may be dropped at the datum position and used as a reference or navigational aid marking the centre of the pattern. An aircraft and a vessel may be used together to perform independent sector searches of the same area. NOTE: Due to the small area involved and the fact that the search vessels cross the datum a number of times, this procedure is less suited to be used simultaneously by (a lot of) multiple vessels. Click the SAR icon in the Toolbar Choose the desired search pattern. In this case: Sector Search The parameter window shows these fields: IAMSAR USCG The initial course should be set in the direction of the wind/tide or overall drift, or else to 000 (true North). Example: Note: For these examples it was decided not to use waypoint names or icons to help the clarity of the diagrams. Following the steps described in “Standard Actions” will give a result that looks like this: IAMSAR Search starts at the CSP. USCG Search starts at the datum. Note: the search-patterns are loaded as “routes”. And as with any route, you can adapt the appearance of that route (colour, style and width). If you use the option for 2 passes the result will look like this: Note: This search pattern is not shown in the IAMSAR manual or USCG publications. Keywords: FROM STATIONARY OBJECT QUADRANT In the so-called “oil rig pattern”, the search sectors are placed into a quadrant. This pattern is meant to be used when someone has fallen from a stationary object (like an oil rig is, or at least is supposed to be) and the search area is confined to one quadrant. Click the SAR icon in the Toolbar Choose the desired search pattern. In this case: Oil Rig (Quadrant Single) The parameter window shows these fields: Example: Following the steps described in “Standard Actions” (and with these parameters) will give a result that looks like this: This table gives you an estimate of survival times in various water temperatures. This table is only a guideline to emphasize the need for fast action and not a means of setting an arbitrary limit on the search effort.","title":"SAR (Search and Rescue)","component":"sar","version":"","name":"index","url":"/sar/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Aim","hash":"_aim","id":1},{"text":"Requirements","hash":"_requirements","id":2},{"text":"General Guidance","hash":"_general_guidance","id":3},{"text":"What and Why","hash":"_what_and_why","id":4},{"text":"What does SAR_pi do?","hash":"_what_does_sar_pi_do","id":5},{"text":"Why should I want it?","hash":"_why_should_i_want_it","id":6},{"text":"First things first, choose the right search-pattern.","hash":"_first_things_first_choose_the_right_search_pattern","id":7},{"text":"Choose Parallel track search:","hash":"_choose_parallel_track_search","id":8},{"text":"Choose Expanding Square Search:","hash":"_choose_expanding_square_search","id":9},{"text":"Choose Sector search:","hash":"_choose_sector_search","id":10},{"text":"Choose Oil Rig:","hash":"_choose_oil_rig","id":11},{"text":"Terminology","hash":"_terminology","id":12},{"text":"On-scene coordination","hash":"_on_scene_coordination","id":13},{"text":"Initiation of search","hash":"_initiation_of_search","id":14},{"text":"On-board preparation","hash":"_on_board_preparation","id":15},{"text":"Installation","hash":"_installation","id":16},{"text":"Enabling","hash":"_enabling","id":17},{"text":"Operation","hash":"_operation","id":18},{"text":"Search Patterns","hash":"_search_patterns","id":19},{"text":"Top half of the window","hash":"_top_half_of_the_window","id":20},{"text":"Bottom half of the window","hash":"_bottom_half_of_the_window","id":21},{"text":"How to use the SAR search pattern in OpenCPN","hash":"_how_to_use_the_sar_search_pattern_in_opencpn","id":22},{"text":"Operation","hash":"_operation_2","id":23},{"text":"\"Parallel Track\" Search","hash":"_parallel_track_search","id":24},{"text":"Setting up a \"Parallel Track\" pattern.","hash":"_setting_up_a_parallel_track_pattern","id":25},{"text":"Parallel Search with 2 ships.","hash":"_parallel_search_with_2_ships","id":26},{"text":"How to use the SAR search pattern in OpenCPN","hash":"_how_to_use_the_sar_search_pattern_in_opencpn_2","id":27},{"text":"\"Expanding Square\"","hash":"_expanding_square","id":28},{"text":"\"Sector Search\"","hash":"_sector_search","id":29},{"text":"IAMSAR","hash":"_iamsar","id":30},{"text":"USCG","hash":"_uscg","id":31},{"text":"Setting up a \"Sector Search\" pattern.","hash":"_setting_up_a_sector_search_pattern","id":32},{"text":"\"Oil Rig (Quadrant Single)\"","hash":"_oil_rig_quadrant_single","id":33},{"text":"Setting up the \"Oil Rig\" search pattern.","hash":"_setting_up_the_oil_rig_search_pattern","id":34},{"text":"Survival Times in the Water","hash":"_survival_times_in_the_water","id":35}]},"205":{"id":205,"text":"Source: Github Repository Releases: Github Releases Forum: Cruiser’s Forum ShipDriver Thread ShipDriver is intended as a very basic ship simulator. It allows a simulated vessel to be driven across the chart and mimics the appearance of the OpenCPN screen when in actual use. AIS can be recorded and played back with the VDR plugin, allowing the display of collision avoidance situations. This could be useful for training purposes.The simulation can extend to multiplayer scenarios where AIS data from one simulator is sent across a network to another user. Download the installer. https://github.com/Rasbats/ShipDriver_pi/releases Windows: Run the .exe file. Enable the plugin using Tools→Plugins and finding the ShipDriver entry. Press the Enable button. The AIS Preferences are used later They can be left unchecked. After 'Apply'/'Ok' the ShipDriver icon will appear in the toolbar of the main screen. Press the icon to display the simulator control. Use right-click to bring up the menu for selecting the vessel start position. I have chosen a position close to a waypoint. Initially nothing happens but when you press the 'Start' button on the control the ownship icon appears, coloured red. If you have not chosen a start position a warning notice will appear. At the same time the Grib plugin form appears. Grib data is used for the sail option The Grib form can be closed at this point. The basic controls for using the simulator are shown here: The best way of learning is to use the tiller and speed controls and watch the effect. When using the tiller an indicator at the top shows the rudder position. There is also a digital readout, either side of the 'Midships' button. The 'Auto' button directly controls the heading. 'Standby' stops the function. Using the tiller while the Auto function is active will override and stop 'Auto'. 'Auto' active: 'Sail' uses the wind data from a Grib file to determine the speed of the boat. A polar from an 'Open 60' forms the basis for this. Press 'Sail'. By adjusting the heading the speed of the boat will change accordingly. If the Grib plugin is not using a file that covers the present time/location a warning appears. The speed control is not active when the 'Sail' option is in use. when 'Sail' is active the button changes colour from green to red. Press 'Sail' again to stop this mode. In Tools→Plugins the 'Preferences' button for ShipDriver is used to select the AIS options. When recording AIS a text file is created that can be played back with the VDR plugin. This records AIS data from 'Own Ship'. This data is nearly the same as seen when meeting a vessel transmitting a Class B AIS signal in the real world. AIS being recorded: ShipDriver has been stopped and the AIS file is being played back using the VDR plugin: By moving the vessel start position, re-starting and running ShipDriver, at the same time as playing the AIS with 'VDR_pi' a collision regs scenario can be created. Obtain the AIS data for the 'other vessel' by using 'right-click' on the target. Using Tools→Plugins and 'Preferences' for the plugin select the 'Transmit' option. When ShipDriver is in use an AIS signal will be transmitted from 'Own Ship'. This has limited use when OpenCPN is used on a single computer. However, on a network it is possible to transmit the data to another computer running ShipDriver allowing two users to simulate collision avoidance situations.","title":"ShipDriver","component":"shipdriver","version":"","name":"index","url":"/shipdriver/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Links","hash":"_links","id":1},{"text":"1.

The edit page has a Google map which can be used to adjust the exact location of the destination, and three tabs, that allow you to specify some basic info about the destination (phone number, email address etc), write and intro paragraph, or add a number of keyword-value pairs that provide additional information. All this updates the Destination page once the edits are saved. User reviews are entered in the form of user comments in the Media Feed, at the bottom of the page. Yes. That’s what the above keyword-value pairs are for. With this approach, you have an unlimited number of potential attributes to define the destination.

Tactics_pi a performance enhancement to Dashboard_pi Rev 1.0 Everything started with the question : “Do we make it around the corner of that island when we tack now and sail the same apparent wind angle on the other tack ?“ Disclaimer : This is still alpha code (not even beta), and you should not use it for live – real sailing. I will not be liable for any harm, damage or whatever strange things happen if you use this plugin and rely on its data. To sail Target-VMG / Target-CMG angle, simply steer the blue HDT pointer on one of the Target-VMG / - CMG markers. As you can see here, there may be 2 red CMG markers, the preferred one has the biggersize ! image::tactics_pi_html_e5a6bb1a90e84af8.png[image,width=175] Calculate true wind data : TWA, TWD, TWS from true heading (HDT), speed through water (STW) and app. Wind speed (AWS), with optional correction by heel-angle. Calculation is enabled via a preference setting and disables available true wind data from the bus throughout the tactics_pi plugin. Calculate the “leeway”, the boat drift based on heel. A common formula is used for that purpose. Calculate the surface sea current and display it as single instruments (current speed/direction) as part of the “Bearing compass” or as overlay on the chart (semi transparent). The routines take boat heel and leeway into account. If you don’t have a heel sensor, there is a simply workaround, see below. Current display on the chart can be disabled by a preference setting. Calculate and display the boat laylines for the current tack, and the same TWA on the other tack. Sea current is taken into account, if available ! Laylines may be toggled on/off. Adjustable length and max. width (triangle, with one corner at the boat) of the boat laylines. The layline width reflects the boat’s yawing (COG changes over time). Load a polar file and calculate/display performance data, like actual VMG (velocity made good up-/downwind), Target-VMG, Target-TWA (the opt. TWA up-/downwind), CMG (course made good towards a waypoint), Target-CMG (opt. CMG angle and speed), polar speed (the speed you should be able to sail at current TWA/TWS based on your polar),… Display the actual polar as overlay on the chart, including markers for Target-VMG/CMG angles. Just adopt your course and place your heading pointer on one of the markers, and you sail Target-VMG/CMG based on your polar … Set a (one !) temporary tactics waypoint and display the laylines to the mark, based on a Target-TWA calculation, while taking your polar into account. It has a “dial instruments” called “Bearing compass”. Boat true heading (HDT) points “up”, it shows the boat laylines as well, the surface current, a pointer to the waypoint (either set manually as the temporary Tactics waypoint or read from a NMEA RMB sentence), needles for AWA and TWA, markers for the Target-VMG/CMG angles. It has a “Polar compass” instrument, graphically displaying the actual polar ring and markers for Bearing to WP, Target-VMG angles and Target-CMG angles. It has an “Average Wind” instrument with an adjustable averaging time, which displays graphically the average wind and its deviations to port / starboard It can create specific NMEA performance records with the purpose to export them to the displays of your instruments. You can now e.g. calculate the polar target speed in the plugin and send it to your instrument display outside in the cockpit. Currently only available for NKE, but may be enhanced in the future. There are various settings, which I grouped in a separate tab. To access the preferences screen, right mouse click on the tactics_pi window, then select “Preferences …” You’ll find all seetings in a separate tab “Performance Parameters” : There are so-called ToolTips available for almost all of the preferences. Just hover the mouse over one of the prefs: Required You will need to activate OpenGL, if you want to use the chart overlay functions. SOG, COG from the GPS Preferably True Heading from an electronic compass. if not available, magnetic heading will do, as long as you have magnetic variance available (either from the GPS RMC sentence or from the wmm_pi plugin) Boat speed through water from a log / “paddlewheel” sensor Apparent wind angle and apparent wind speed Heel sensor which supplies your boat heel angle to Oas XDR sentence If not available, there’s a workaround with manual input You need a polar file of your boat to use all polar based performance calculations Calibrate AWA, Compass HDG/HDT, STW (Speed through water), and AWS (apparent wind speed) as good as possible. Especially the compass heading calibration tends to be neglected. But this is vital for a proper surface current calculation. All I can say is : sh* in – sh* out … See also the Terminology at the very end for explanation of terms The plugin can calculate true wind data (TWA, TWS, TWD) but keeps the calculated data inside the plugin (it does not broadcast it to O)! True wind calculation is done silently if you don’t have TWA, TWS, TWD available in your NMEA stream. Furthermore you can force the true wind calculation in the plugin by a preference setting. If the tick “Force True Wind Calculation” is set. It does not matter if TWA, TWS and TWD are already available on the system or not. Calculation is done in the plugin then. It does calculate TWA, TWS and TWD. This is e.g. useful, if you have a heel sensor, which is not integrated in your instrument bus. You can use the corrections then to get more accurate true wind data. Input is AWA, AWS, STW, and for TWD also true heading HDT. If you don’t have HDT on your system bus (but only HDG), you can use wmm_pi. wmm_pi supplies the magnetic variation and if running is taken into account to calculate HDT from HDG If you have a heel sensor in your system, and its data is available in O, you can use two corrections. Correct STW with Leeway: The plugin can calculate your leeway (drift angle) based on on your heel sensor (see below). That means your boat is possibly moving sideways, which adds an error to the True Wind calculation. Standard instruments normally do not take this effect into account, as far as I know. NKE does this correction in its regatta processor only, but not on their normal instruments. Correct AWS/AWA with Heel: This option corrects your AWS and AWA data by the heel angle. Use this option with great care !. Manufacturers normally already do correct this, if you have a heel sensor integrated in your instrument bus. O will simply receive the already corrected data for AWS / AWA then. The result would be wrong data ! I implemented this option for those sailors using an external (or DIY) heel sensor, which is not recognized by their instrument system. You’ll get a warning popup as soon as you set the tick. Use SOG instead of STW for True Wind Calc: Replaces STW (Speed through water, the “log”) with SOG (from the GPS) in the internal true wind calculation. The idea is simply to have a fallback for the true wind calculation in case your log fails and also to eliminate side effects on the calculation by surface current. Leeway describes the drift of the boat due to the force of the wind. Leeway is the basic input for the surface current calculation described later on. Input for the leeway calculation is your heel angle. Normally you’d say : the more you heel, the more you drift . But that’s only part of the truth. Other significant inputs are boat speed and the shape of your hull… A widely (NKE, B&G,…) used formula calculates the leeway with 3 input values : heel, boat speed (STW), and hullshape-factor. Leeway = hullshape-factor*heel/(STW*STW) To make this work, you have to estimate the hullshape-factor. The attribute in the preferences is called “Boat’s Leeway factor [0..20]:” The input range is 0…20, 10 is a good value to start with. If you don’t have a heel sensor on board, you can either set a fixed value ( e.g. 0 when motoring without sails), or try to set up a very simple “heel polar”. Heel polar: The idea is that almost every magnetic compass installed in the cockpits has a scale, where you can read the degrees of heel. Then simply compare the O instruments display, for TWA and TWS, read the values from the scale and put it into the small table above. Please be sure to read True Wind Angle and True Wind Speed and not apparent wind angle and speed !!! I tried it on my own boat, comparing the heel polar values with those of my sensor. It works astonishingly well. Even if you use the heel-polar, you have to estimate the “Boat’s Leeway factor [0..20]:” You have 3 choices for heel input, depending on where you set the radio button in the preferences. You can switch the radio buttons forth and back while sailing to compare the results, no problem The attribute “fixed/max Leeway [°]:” is dual purpose: The given value is always taken into account as maximum possible Leeway value.In the screenshot below, I set it to 30°. If your heel polar or calculation with the formula above outputs values >30°, the program takes 30°. If you set the radio button here, the routines always take 30°, no matter what your sensor calculates or your heel-polar would tell you. If you compare your HDT and COG vectors in O (the 2 forward vectors on the chart at your boat), the difference between both is a mixture between Leeway (the boat’s drift) and surface current. Once we can determine Leeway, the rest is surface current. The surface current calculation is simply a triangle calculation with vectors. Always seen from the current position, the first vector is HDT (degrees) / STW (length). As your boat drifts with the wind, the second vector is “course through water” (CRS, degrees) and STW (length) “course through water” is actually HDT with applied leeway. The resulting vector between CRS/STW and COG/SOG is the surface current. To calculate the current, you need as input HDT, STW, Leeway, COG and SOG and your GPS latitude / longitude. In the preferences you can set 2 options for the current : the damping factor : the lower the values are the more filtering is applied, and the reading gets more stable. On the other hand, it starts lagging a bit. The lower the value, the more damping is applied. Actually I’m experimenting in the range of 0.001 to 0.025. Keep this value at the lower end, the start to increase, until it gets unstable. You can show a semi transparent blue current symbol underneath your boat, showing the surface current direction. To activate the current display on the chart by default, upon program start, navigate to the Preferences dialogue and set the tick “Display Current on Chart (OpenGL)”. The preference is only setting the default. While navigating in OpenCPN, you can turn the current overlay display on / off as you like. Just right-click on any Tactics_pi instrument and select “Show Current”. This toggles the display on/off. You can show the boat laylines on the chart. They refer to COG. The colours mean red = wind from port green = wind from starboard. The width is defined by the yawing of your boat, the more you yaw, the wider they get The second layline (green in this example) simply shows you where you would get on the other tack / gybe when you sail the same TWA after the tack. Leeway and current are taken into accountfor the calculation of the second layline. In the preferences, you can set the following options : The Layline width damping factor is the rate how fast the layline width reacts on COG changes. It’s done with exponential smoothing, the smaller the factor, the higher the damping rate. You can define the length of the laylines on the chart, as well as a minimum and maximum width. If you don’t like the yawing effect simply set min and max both to 1 or 2 degrees. To toggle the layline display on the chart on/off, right-click on the tactics_pi main window and select “Show laylines” You can also show a wind barb at the boat position, showing you direction and speed (feather length) in 5 kt steps To activate the wind barb display on the chart by default, upon program start, navigate to the Preferences dialogue and set the tick “Display Wind Barb on Chart (OpenGL)”. The preference is only setting the default. While navigating in OpenCPN, you can turn the wind barb overlay display on / off as you like. Just right-click on any Tactics_pi instrument and select “Show Windbarb”. This toggles the display on/off. I took the basic code for the wind barbs from the tack and laylines plugin, but had to adopt the transit from one barb to the next level. Furthermore it to show the barbs up to 47 knots correctly now (it ends at 30 kts in the original code) This is the currently implemented wind barb scale (0-2kts has no feather at all) : Current direction means “current sets into …” In this example we heel to starboard ! Boat drifts 0.5° to starboard due to heel It’s meant to do a quick check of the TWA on the (new) tack prior to sailing the tack/gybe maneuver. Either place a WP in the GPS( NMEA–> RMB) or simply drop the TacticsWP on the new course line. As with the other functions, the “Tactics temp.WP” overrules the RMB coming in from a GPS. It should give you an idea which gennaker/spi or sail to select on the next tack. I added the TWD to the dial instrument; this saves some space on the screen for an extra instrument I created a new graphical instrument which shows the average wind and its deviations to both sides. The curve is centered on the average wind, green means the wind is on starboard of the actual average wind, red means it blows more from port. You can adjust the averaging time in steps of 1 [min] between 6 and 30 mins. The red number in the center is the average wind direction, left and right is the min and max (unfiltered) wind angles to either side. The very thin lines are the unfiltered wind direction input from the instruments. To adjust the time average, just pull the slider left / right. The vertical scale is [minutes], short dashes every minute, full horizontal line every 5 minutes. The instrument has its own timer, so it’s independent of the connection speed. The idea is: if you sail in puffy, changing winds, that you see graphically when the wind changes to the other side. In theory, you should tack, as soon as the wind veers away and crosses the average wind direction … As you can see in the examples above there are definitely cycles, where the wind changes direction. You can load a polar file from the preferences screen Click on the load button and select a polar file. The format is the same that polar_pi uses (or better: used last summer). I took the basic code from there, to keep the plugins consistent. This is also the reason why I did not spend time in displaying the polar again. You can use polar_pi instead. When loading the polar, it is written to a 2 dimensional static array with 181 lines for each TWA degree (0…180°) and 61 rows (0…60) for each knot of windspeed. It’s a simple lookup table for the latter use, with the purpose to reduce the processor load and increase access speed in normal use. Loading Procedure : The whole array is prefilled with NAN values. The values from the polar file are placed at their corresponding spots in the array The missing data in between given values (= not NAN) is then filled with average values. Please note : Only polars with TWA / TWS / STW, and TWS/STW in knots make sense I do not extrapolate polars beyond their outside limits. If you run in a 30kt wind, and your polar ends at 25 kts, then the performance instruments will give you a “no polar data” text. I suggest that you turn polar_pi / vdr_pi on at that point and record your data The only exception of the extrapolation is the range between the 0 kts windspeed and the first given value. I do simple averaging here. In other words : if yellow is the whole polar from TWS 0-60 kts and TWA 0-180°prefilled with NAN, and red is your polar data, you will get the green square filled with data. See the ini file chapter, how you can read out the array as a text file (see key PolarLookupTableOutputFile=…). Here is an example of a polar file starting at 50° TWA And this is the corresponding lookup table dumped to a file using the ini key PolarLookupTableOutputFile True wind speed values are averaged now. True wind angle is still rounded to the next full knot. For testing I implemented full averaging of TWS &TWA as well , but live comparisons didn’t show improvement. I think this is a good compromise to average TWS only, as I’m pretty sure that TWA won’t be more accurate than one knot, due tu upwash issues, position and accuracy of the wind vane, compass accuracy, etc. You can display the polar as overlay on the chart.. The size of the different polar “rings” is normalized, they all have the same size. Nevertheless, the plugin always shows the current / correct polar ring. The polar orientation is related to the true wind direction, and it shows blue markers for the Target-VMG angles up- and downwind, and red markers for the Target-CMG angles (if you have an active NMEA-RMB-sentence or a Tactics_pi waypoint set). There’s also a small blue HDT line diplayed. I decided to add an additional marker for Hdt, because I found it easier than always remembering which of the 2 red default markers is Heading and which one is Course over ground … To sail Target-VMG / Target-CMG angle, simply steer the blue HDT pointer on one of the Target-VMG / - CMG markers. As you can see here, there may be 2 red CMG markers, the preferred one has the biggersize ! To activate the polar display on the chart by default, upon program start, navigate to the Preferences dialogue and set the tick “Show polar on chart (OpenGL)”. The preference is only setting the default. While navigating in OpenCPN, you can turn the polar overlay display on / off as you like. Just right-click on any Tactics_pi instrument and select “Show Polar”. This toggles the display on/off. various performance data is available as text instruments. See the following chart for reference on the different terms in relation to a polar curve image::tactics_pi-3.4-performance-data.jpeg[image::tactics_pi-3.4-performance-data.jpeg[tactics_pi-3.4-performance-data.jpg,title=\"tactics_pi-3.4-performance-data.jpg\",width=450]] For some of the instruments I split the display in a % value for your current speed in relation of the polar data value as 100%. In this example, we’re currently doing (only) 51%, of what the polar has stored as optimum value. According to the polar we should be able to do 11.95 knots. The reason to do so was simply that the data belongs together anyway and so to save space on the screen This is simply the reference of what speed we should be able to sail based on our current TWA / TWS values. The % value is the reference to STW. This is actual boat speed versus polar speed in the drawing above. Values below 100% mean, where slower than the polar says, above 100% mean where faster than the polar (we should run vdr_pi now to record the data) Useful in crosswind / reaching conditions without a waypoint It shows the optimum speed for the given wind conditions. Is the “Velocity made good” refering to the wind direction. The means we’re moving with 6,27 kts into wind direction. Also works when we sail downwind (then it’s off the wind) VMG = STW * cosine (True Wind Angle) Also known as Target TWA;this is the optimum TWA (True Wind Angle) when sailing upwind or downwind for a given wind speed, based on your polar data. Very useful when sailing up-/downwind without a waypoint. The program simply searches the polar with a given TWS for the optimum TWA up-/downwind. It’s defined as the tangens on the polar. Also known as “target boat speed” (target speed in the diagram above) This is the reference to the Target VMG-Angle. In our example it means : If we would sail with 164° TWA (from ex. above), then we could make 11.95 knots according polar), but currently we’re doing only 51% of that. Actual Course Made Good = aka VMC; the component of your boat speed towards a waypoint. We’re moving with 8.36 knots towards a waypoint CMG = STW * cosine (Heading - Marks bearing) Quite valuable on reaching courses towards a waypoint. Optimum angle to sail fastest to a waypoint, based on your polar data (Like VMG, but not up-/downwind but towards a waypoint). Same as Target VMG, but towards a waypoint. Means : “If we would sail 130° (Target CMG Angle, from ex. Above), we would move towards the waypoint with 11.98 knots, but currently we’re only doing 64% of that. Comment : Calculation is verified, but it doesn’t tell you (yet) if you’re on the correct tack – sail trimming aid – image::tactics_pi_html_da2f37f0cc23eddc.png[image,width=500] A new graphical instrument like Wind-History or Baro-History. It simply plots the STW (speed through water) as percentage of the polar speed data (=100%) for the actual true wind speed TWS and true wind angle TWA. It is this comparison in the polar chart above, plotted as % The idea is a simple sail trimming aid, as the percentage value is quite stable in comparison to the real speed values. And TWA / TWS is constantly adjusted while reading the polar data. Message : as long as the filtered curve points upwards your trim adjustments were right, if it points down, you’re sailing worse than before … Comment : Still needs probably adjustments with the damping factor, # of points plotted, etc. image::tactics_pi_html_7df2819eefd84ee5.png[image,width=240] Nice dial instrument, inspired by NKEs tactics page, which I called Bearing Compass. UP- direction is HDT, in this example (356°T) Surface Current: We see the blue surface current arrow based on boat heading (HDT) and the current speed “Curr: 0.68 kn” image::tactics_pi_html_2360a32100cbea17.png[image,width=90] Needles for TWA and AWA : Furthermore we have the blue, thin arrow, which is TWA on boat axis. It also shows the TWD on the degree scale (315°) and the AWA arrow in orange/yellow (standard dashboard colour) Laylines : You see the red/green laylines, which are based on COG. As with the laylines on the chart, the second layline shows you where you end up sailing the same TWA on the other tack. Leeway and current are taken into account. Use the second layline together with the waypoint marker described below. Please note : the calculation is based on TWA. Especially when sailing downwind with a gennaker, your apparent wind angle depends very much on the speed of the boat. As soon as the gennaker start working aerodynamically, it’ll speed up the boat and your AWA will show lower values (points more foreward). If you gybe now, your boat speed will drop, and although sailing the same TWA, your app. wind angle will be higher than before. You will have to bring you boat back up to speed to see the same AWA than before the tack. This can be tricky when you’re close to a buoy and don’t have much space/time to speed up your boat again. Target VMG Angle indicator : The blue triangle outside the degree scale is the Target-VMG Angle (Target TWA) Simply adopt your course to place your blue TWA-arrow on the Target-VMG pointer, and you sail optimum (polar based) speed up-/or downwind. Waypoint marker : If a waypoint is active, either by a NMEA-RMB sentence from your GPS or the temporary tactics WP which you can place on the chart, you will see the WP as a red dot. The manually placed tactics WP overrules a parallel available RMB sentence image::tactics_pi_html_10372e02fd2691c0.png[image,width=240] Change your course and place it under the layline ( the red one in this example) and you will directly bump into it. Or use the second layline to determine when it is time to tack towards the waypoint and when you will make it around the WP (the red dot should be outside the second layline then) Additional data : The top 2 corners show the bearing to the WP and the name of the WP (See screenshot above). The lower 2 corners give you DTW = the distance to the WP and predicted speed over ground on the other tack, assuming that you sail the same TWA on the other tack. This simply drops out of the surface current calculation … I derived this instrument from Bearing Compass. Once you loaded a polar, it shows you the actual polar ring. The size of the ring is normalized (always the same size). The polar is rotated with the TWD, which is shown as thin blue line here. In this example True Wind Direction is ~226°, the wind is blowing from port aft. Please note the vertical True Heading line, highlighted in green here : The 4 blue markers (triangles) are showing the Target-VMG-Angles up- and downwind. They are based on the actual polar ring and are moving with the with the polar. The red maker(s) (triangles) are the Target-CMG Angles towards a Waypoint. They are only shown if you have an active Waypoint set (via NMEA-RMB or the ‘temp. TacticsWP’). The red dot inside the compass shows the bearing to the waypoint. In contrary to Bearing Compass, the VMG/CMG markers are shown in conjunction with the polar and are rotating with the polar/true wind angle. To sail optimum VMG- or CMG-Angle, change your course in a way that the boats heading line (green markup above) points on one of the markers. Top left and right data fields show DTW = Distance to Waypoint Waypoint name (here : TacticsWP) The centered data is STW = Speed Through Water The 2 bottom fields are T-PS : Target-PolarSpeed on the left PolarSpeed-% = the percentage of you actual STW compared to the Target-PolarSpeed. Furthermore you see the laylines which are based on CoG. In this example, there is a angle btw. the HDT line and the layline, so we have a significant drift ! There may be 2 red CMG pointers, based on Bearing and True Wind direction. Generally one of them is preferred, because you approach the WP faster. The preferred one has a bigger size !!! *For those who are interested in the theory of CMG calculation*, see the following example with the markups below: We have TWD, shown with the bluearrow. The polar is rotated with TWD. Next we have the bearing to our WP, see the solid purple line “Bearing”. From this solid purple bearing line, we have to find the tangens on the polar curve to both sides. The tangens is – in relation to the purple bearing line – the highest point of the polar curve. Graphically one draws perpendicular lines from the purple bearing line to either side until it just touches the polar curve. The length on the purple bearing line, measured from the 0-point of the polar, to the perpendicular intersections (marked CMG) corresponds to the Target CMG speed. You can right-click on any place in the chart and drop a temporary waypoint (exactly one). As soon as you activate the layline display, the plugin will do a Target-TWA calculation to that WP, based on the current TWD and your boat polar. Surface current is taken into account. You can delete that waypoint as any other WP. Select it with right click and choose “Delete”. You can drag the waypoint on the chart, it behaves like a normal waypoint. Depending on your settings in O you may have to open the WP properties to drag. Currently it takes the Target-VMG (Target-TWA) angle up-/downwind and applies it to our boat as well as to the mark (Tactics temp. WP). If there is a line intersection, it chops off the lines at the intersection, et voilà …. Colours green and red are again the wind directions green = wind from starboard, red = wind from port Additionally I do a polar based calculation to see if the direct course would be faster compared to the Target-VMG calculation. In that case you’ll get a red or green line directly to the waypoint. Colour depends on the side the wind is blowing from. Wind from port → red, wind from starboard → green As you can see here I’m placing a wind barb also on the tactics waypoint. Please note : In contrast to weather routing, I’m explicitly not using grib files here for current/wind info. The “Temp. Tactics Waypoint” is meant for a quick, near run around a buoy, cape of an island, etc. using the live wind data we currently experience and the momentary surface current. Just drop a mark on the chart and off you go. Delete it, drop it somewhere else, and boom, off you go again. Maximum one tack/gybe not more. NKE supports the upload of specific performance data to their instrument bus, which can be shown in their displays then. These records are polar based and unless you’re using their (quite expensive) regatta processor, this gives us an easy way to display e.g. the “Target Polar Speed” outside in the cockpit on the standard instrument displays. Due to the lack of information on other manufacturers capabilities, I implemented this for the NKE system right now. Be aware that OpenCPN can only import/export NMEA183 right now, but not NMEA2000 or SeaTalk. The following 5 records are implemented : Speed and performance target $PNKEP,01,x.x,N,x.x,K*hh | \\ target speed in km/h \\ target speed in knots Course on next tack $PNKEP,02,x.x*hh \\ Course (COG) on other tack from 0 to 359° Opt. VMG angle and performance up and downwind $PNKEP,03,x.x,x.x,x.x*hh | | \\ performance downwind from 0 to 99% \\ \\ performance upwind from 0 to 99% \\ opt. VMG angle 0 à 359° Angles to optimise CMG and VMG and corresponding gain (available but to be verified) $PNKEP,04,x.x,x.x,x.x,x.x*hh | | | \\ Gain VMG from 0 to 999% \\ \\ \\ Angle to optimise VMG from 0 to 359° \\ \\ Gain CMG from 0 to 999% \\ Angle to optimise CMG from 0 to 359° Direction and speed of sea current $PNKEP,05,x.x,x.x,N,x.x,K*hh | \\ \\current speed in km/h \\ \\ current speed in knots \\ current direction from 0 à 359° There is a new tab now in the Preferences where you can define up to 5 performance NMEA183 records to be created. These 5 NMEA183-records all begin with $PNKEP and are created on the fly using the data calculated in the plugin and are sent to OpenCPNs NMEA stream. To send the records to your instruments, you have to define an outgoing connection in you Interface connections, e.g. like this : image::tactics_pi_html_fc7b91fa785071fe.png[image::tactics_pi_html_fc7b91fa785071fe.png[image]] Set an output filter as shown above, filtering for PNKEP. After set up, you should see records beginning whith $PNKEP, in your NMEA debug window. NKE exports the $PNKEP sentences as soon as they’re available on the topline bus. Normally they’re calculated in their regatta processor and then exported to the PC. Therefore ignore all incoming $PNKEP sentences ! Click on Input filtering (see screenshot above), select Ignore sentences and add PNKEP. Don’t forget to re-init your NMEA data stream in your instruments, to make sure the new records are accepted. I added a complete tab “Performance parameters” with all the settings The Apply button set the global variables which are used for the preferences directly, without closing the pref’s window. All parameters are written to the opencpn.ini file using the standard “dashboard” functionality, i.e. when closing tactics_pi itself. I’ll add a “Save” button here, which directly writes to the ini file. You’ll find all keys under section [PlugIns/Tactics] and subsequent sections starting with [PlugIns/Tactics/…] The basic setup is inherited from dashboard_pi, I did not change any of the “original dashboard” keys, but added some Relevant are : **[PlugIns/Tactics]**… * CurrentDampingFactor=0.003 * MinLaylineWidth=2 * MaxLaylineWidth=30 * LaylineWidthDampingFactor=0.2 * ShowCurrentOnChart=1 * LaylineLenghtonChart=5 **[PlugIns/Tactics/BearingCompass]** * DampingDeltaCoG=0.4 * MinLaylineDegrees=2 * MaxLaylineDegrees=30 **[PlugIns/Tactics/Performance]** * PolarFile=C:\\\\apps\\\\OpenCPN 4.1.925\\\\plugins\\\\weather_routing_pi\\\\data\\\\polars\\\\Aki950routage.pol * PolarLookupTableOutputFile=C:\\\\temp\\\\Polar.txt * BoatLeewayFactor=8 * fixedLeeway=30 * UseHeelSensor=1 * UseFixedLeeway=0 * UseManHeelInput=0 * UseSOGforTWCalc=1 * Heel_5kn_45Degree=5 * Heel_5kn_90Degree=5 * Heel_5kn_135Degree=10 * Heel_10kn_45Degree=8 * Heel_10kn_90Degree=10 * Heel_10kn_135Degree=11 * Heel_15kn_45Degree=25 * Heel_15kn_90Degree=20 * Heel_15kn_135Degree=13 * Heel_20kn_45Degree=20 * Heel_20kn_90Degree=16 * Heel_20kn_135Degree=15 * Heel_25kn_45Degree=25 * Heel_25kn_90Degree=20 * Heel_25kn_135Degree=20 * UseSOGforTWCalc=1 * ExpPolarSpeed=1 * ExpCourseOtherTack=0 * ExpTargetVMG=1 * ExpVMG_CMG_Diff_Gain=0 * ExpCurrent I think they are selfexplaining, if you compare the settings with the preferences screenshot above. All damping factors are “alpha” from the standard exponential smoothing formula, except CurrentDampingFactorwhere I’m using double exponential smoothing at the moment. They should range between something above 0 and 1, the smaller the number, the higher the damping, 1 means no filtering at all Recommendation : Use CurrentDampingFactorwith low values, like 0.03 to get a stable reading One interesting key, which is not available in the preferences screen is PolarLookupTableOutputFile As explained earlier, the polar file is loaded into an array. When you set this key, you can dump that array to a (tab delimited) text file, which can be read e.g. with notepad++. As mentioned earlier, this array is prefilled with NAN values, NANs are reflected in the file as “-1.#J”. If you want to see/check that, just add that key manually under section [PlugIns/Tactics/Performance] Make sure the path exists and the given file is writeable. There’s no safety checks implemented here, so use at your own risk. There are more keys and sections for tactics_pi but all others came with dashboard_pi and were not touched by me. Wind barb display on chart ends at 47 knots. Any windspeed higher than that is displayed as “45 knots”. With more than 47 kts, I’m personally not really interested anymore in a correct wind barb display … Term Description AWA Apparent Wind Angle; the relative wind angle measured by your wind sensor, related to the boat axis(0°…180°) AWS Apparent Wind Speed; the relative speed of the wind measured by your wind sensor CMG Course Made Good; the speed approaching a waypoint COG Course Over Ground; generally supplied by the GPS HDG Magnetic heading of your compass; not compensated with magnetic variation HDT True heading of your compass. “True” means compensated with magnetic variation Heel The angular degrees how your boat is heeled (leaning) sideways due to any force from outside (wave, wind, water ballast on one side of the boat, swing keel etc….) CRS Course through water; HDT + Leeway, but without currents Leeway The drift of your boat based on the wind. As soon as the wind is blowing it implies a force on your boat, the boat starts drifting. Leeway is NOT including any drift due to surface currents! That’s actually the challenge.

TwoCan - An OpenCPN Plugin for integrating OpenCPN with NMEA2000® networks. It enables some NMEA2000® data to be directly integrated with OpenCPN by converting some NMEA2000® messages to NMEA 183 sentences and inserting them into the OpenCPN data stream. TwoCan support Windows, Linux (including RaspberryPi) and Mac OSX. For Windows it uses a “plug-in” driver model to support different CAN bus adapters and different log file formats. Four hardware adapters are currently supported: Kvaser Leaflight HS v2 Canable Contact Axiomtek AX92903 Rusoku Toucan Marine Five log file formats are currently supported (with examples of their file format): TwoCan: 0x01,0x01,0xF8,0x09,0x64,0xD9,0xDF,0x19,0xC7,0xB9,0x0A,0x04 Candump (Linux utilty): (1542794025.315691) can0 1DEFFF03#A00FE59856050404 Kees Verruijt’s Canboat: 2014-08-14T19:00:00.042,3,128267,1,255,8,0B,F5,0D,8D,24,01,00,00 Yacht Devices: 19:07:47.607 R 0DF80503 00 2B 2D 9E 44 5A A0 A1 PCAP packet Capture (eg. Wireshark):binary format, refer to https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-gharris-opsawg-pcap-00.html For Windows, the default file name for each of the input log files are: twocanraw.log, candump.log, kees.log and yachtdevices.log and twocan.pcap respectively. For Linux it does not use a “plug-in” driver model, rather it uses three “baked in” classes that support the SocketCAN interface, PCAP packet capture format and a generic Log File Reader. Any CAN bus adapter that supports the SocketCAN interface “should” work. It has been tested with native interfaces (eg. can0), serial interfaces (eg. slcan0) and virtual interfaces (eg. vcan0). Several hardware adapters have been successfully tested under Linux: Canable Cantact - (see above) Rusoku Toucan Marine (see above) Waveshare CAN Hat for Raspberry PI - https://www.waveshare.com/rs485-can-hat.htm USBTin - USBTin Copperhill Tech PICAN-M for Raspberry Pi - https://copperhilltech.com/pican-m-nmea-0183-nmea-2000-hat-for-raspberry-pi/ A good reference to using & configuring the CAN interfaces on Linux can be found at: https://elinux.org/Bringing_CAN_interface_up Above, a Raspberry Pi with Waveshare CAN Hat installed. The Linux Log File Reader automagically™ detects the four supported log file formats. The default file name for the input log file is twocan.log. The PCAP packet capture log reader default file name is twocan.pcap Similarly the Mac OSX version uses five “baked in” classes, one supporting the generic Log File reader, one supprting the PCAP packet capture format, one supporting the Rusoku Toucan adapter (see above), one supporting the Kvaser Leaf Light adapter (see above) and the other supporting serial USB CAN bus adapters such as the Canable Cantact (also see above). It seems as though the same command set is used by adapters that support the serial SocketCAN interface (SLCAN), so while the Mac OSX plugin’s Canable Cantact driver was developed purely for that device, it may also work with other serial USB Can bus adapters such as the USBTin (see above) and Lawicell adapters. The plugin automagically™ detects these three adapters using their respective USB Vendor Id’s and product Id’s and may work with serial USB devices other then the Canable Cantact. NMEA 2000 frames may be logged by the plugin. By default they are written to the user’s home directory and named using the following convention: twocan-YYYY-MM-DD_HHmmSS.log The TwoCan Plugin source code is available at https://github.com/TwoCanPlugIn/TwoCanPlugIn The TwoCan Plugin Windows drivers are available at https://github.com/TwoCanPlugIn/TwoCanPluginDrivers == Aim The aim of the TwoCan plugin is to allow OpenCPN to integrate with modern NMEA2000® networks and use the data directly from those sensors without relying on additional gateways or converters. Navigation data such as position, speed, depth, wind and time can be incorporated into OpenCPN without the need for feeding legacy NMEA 0183 data via serial communications or TCP/IP. The plug-in supports Position, Speed, Depth. Wind, Time, AIS, DSC, Engine, Fluid Levels, Battery Status and Environmental (temperature, pressure, humidity etc.) data which is used directly by OpenCPN or by other plug-ins such as the Dashboard plug-in. With version 1.9 and newer, the plugin is now directly supported by OpenCPN 5.2 and the Plugin Manager. Once you have updated your Master Catalogue, the plugin can be directly installed from the Plugin Manager. For versions prior to 1.9 1. After compiling and creating the standalone installation package for TwoCan, use the resulting installer to install the TwoCan plugin. 2. If using Windows compile the TwoCan plugin drivers. At present they do not have an installation package so you must manually copy the drivers (Windows DLL’s) into the “twocan_pi\\drivers” folder. This folder will be found in the “plugins” folder of your OpenCPN installation which in a default installation will be found in the “program files\\opencpn” folder on your System drive. For example on a standard Windows system it may be: “c:\\program files\\opencpn\\plugins\\twocan_pi\\drivers” 1. Enable the TwoCan Plugin from the OpenCPN Options dialog. 2, From the TwoCan Preferences dialog, use the Settings tab to select the appropriate driver from the drop down list, and select the required NMEA2000® PGN’s, For Linux users, if any SocketCAN driver is installed, it will be displayed in the drop down list, together with the Log File Reader. If using the hardware drivers you may log the raw data. At present the raw data is hard coded to write log files to the user’s home directory; for Windows usually the “My Documents” folder, for Linux and Mac OSX, “home” aka “~” 3. From the TwoCan Preferences dialog, you may use the Debug tab to observe the converted NMEA 0183 sentences in real time. Sentences may also be copied to the clipboard. Note: The same sentences may also be viewed from OpenCPN if the “Show NMEA Debug Window” is selected from the OpenCPN Connection Settings dialog. A new feature introduced with version 1.4 is the ability to enable TwoCan to participate on the NMEA 2000® network. The TwoCan plugn will acquire an address on the network and respond to a few network requests such as requests for address claims, device capabilities and product information. For the more technically minded, that means the Plugin supports the following Parameter Group Number (PGN’s): 59904 ISO Request, 60928 Address Claim, 126993 Heartbeat, 126996 Product Information. This feature is confgured on an additional settings page. In addition, the plugin attempts to build a “map” of the network by listing all of the active devices on the network and attempting to display their NMEA 2000® network address, manufacturer and model id. As the device responds to standard NMEA 2000® network requests, its presence is also displayed on third party NMEA 2000® display devices. From version 2.0 onwards, TwoCan can operate as a bi-directional gateway, converting NMEA 183 sentences to their NMEA 2000 equivalents. The plugin receives NMEA 183 sentences from OpenCPN, converts them to NMEA 2000 and transmits them on the NMEA 2000 network. To determine what NMEA 183 sentences are converted, simply uncheck the corresponding PGN in the TwoCan options dialog. For example if you wish to convert depth data, enable the gateway feature and uncheck PGN 128267, which will then allow conversion of NMEA 183 DBT sentences to NMEA 2000 PGN 128267 messages. The TwoCan plugin persists its configuration settings in the OpenCPN initialization file. Under Windows this file is named “opencpn.ini” and is located in the “ProgramData\\OpenCPN ” folder. For Linux and Mac OSX users, the OpenCPN initialization file is located in the .opencpn directory in the user’s home directory. For example: [PlugIns/TwoCan] PGN=511 Log=0 Adapter=C:\\\\Program Files\\\\OpenCPN\\\\plugins\\\\twocan_pi\\\\drivers\\\\kvaser.dll Mode=0 The TwoCan plugin has undergone very limited testing. It has occasionally crashed OpenCPN, when changing drivers mid stream or selecting a driver for which the underlying hardware is not installed. In this case, manually edit the OpenCPN initializaion file and delete or correct the Adapter entry. For Windows, the drivers that use serial communications (Canable Cantact and Axiomtek AX92903) both attempt to automagically determine their serial port settings but again this has undergone limited testing and may not work correctly. For Linux, the CAN interfaces must be “up”. In general the “ifconfig” command can be used to determine the presence/state of the CAN adapters, and the “ip link” command can be used to bring up the interface. Eg. For a native interface the following command could be used: sudo ip link set up can0. For Mac OSX the plugin automagically detects the serial USB port that the Canable Cantact device is connected to, whilst for the Rusoku Toucan and Kvaser Leaf Light devices the plugin also installs the necessary drivers which are based on the Mac-CAN libraries. For diagnostic purposes, the plugin logs messages into the OpenCPN logfile, For example: 4:52:40 PM: PlugInManager: Loading PlugIn: C:\\Program Files\\OpenCPN\\plugins\\twocan_pi.dll 4:52:40 PM: C:\\Program Files\\OpenCPN\\plugins\\twocan_pi.dll API Version detected: 108 PlugIn Version detected: 100 4:52:40 PM: TwoCan Device, Found driver C:\\Program Files\\OpenCPN\\plugins\\twocan_pi\\drivers\\filedevice.dll 4:52:40 PM: TwoCan Device, Driver Manufacturer: TwoCan 4:52:40 PM: TwoCan Device, Driver Name: Logfile Reader 4:52:40 PM: TwoCan Device, Driver Version: 1.0 4:52:40 PM: TwoCan Device, Loaded driver C:\\Program Files\\OpenCPN\\plugins\\twocan_pi\\drivers\\filedevice.dll 4:52:40 PM: TwoCan Plugin, TwoCan Device Initialized 4:52:40 PM: TwoCan Plugin, Create Device Thread Result: 0 4:52:40 PM: Changing NMEA Datasource for IIGLL to (Priority: 0) 4:52:40 PM: Changing NMEA Datasource for IIMWV to (Priority: 0) 4:52:40 PM: Changing NMEA Datasource for IIVHW to (Priority: 0) 4:52:40 PM: Changing NMEA Datasource for IIMTW to (Priority: 0) 4:52:40 PM: Changing NMEA Datasource for IIZDA to (Priority: 0) 4:52:40 PM: Changing NMEA Datasource for IIVTG to (Priority: 0) 4:52:40 PM: TwoCan Device, Driver Read result: 0 4:52:41 PM: Changing NMEA Datasource for IIGGA to (Priority: 0) 4:52:41 PM: Changing NMEA Datasource for IIDBT to (Priority: 0) 4:52:45 PM: PlugInManager: Deactivating PlugIn: C:\\Program Files\\OpenCPN\\plugins\\twocan_pi.dll 4:52:45 PM: TwoCan Plugin, Device Thread Error Code: 0 Exit Code: 0 4:52:45 PM: opencpn::MyFrame exiting cleanly. 4:52:45 PM: Chart cache PlugIn purge 4:52:45 PM: PlugInManager: Deactivating PlugIn: C:\\Program Files\\OpenCPN\\plugins\\twocan_pi.dll 4:52:45 PM: TwoCan Device, Read Thread terminating 4:52:45 PM: TwoCan Device, Driver Unload Result: 0 4:52:45 PM: Chart cache purge 4:52:45 PM: opencpn::MyApp starting exit. 4:52:45 PM: LOGBOOK: 2018-10-16 16:52:45 UTC OFF: Lat 43.41000 Lon 6.78117 COG 0.00000 SOG 0.00 kts 4:52:45 PM: opencpn::MyApp exiting cleanly… Please report any errors to either the forum or via email to twocanplugin@hotmail.com Why the name “TwoCan” ? Firstly NMEA2000® is based on the Controller Area Network (CAN). Secondly, I recall that the Year 2000 rollover was sometimes referred to as Y2K and that Windows 2000 was sometimes referred to as Win2K, So simply a play on words: NMEA2000® is shortened to 2000 which becomes 2K which ends up as Two and when appended with CAN becomes TwoCAN. But more importantly, every software project needs a cool icon ! NMEA2000® is a registered Trademark of the National Marine Electronics Association.","title":"TwoCan","component":"twocan","version":"0.1","name":"index","url":"/twocan/0.1/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Installation","hash":"_installation","id":1},{"text":"Usage","hash":"_usage","id":2},{"text":"Bi-Directional gateways","hash":"_bi_directional_gateways","id":3},{"text":"Configuration Settings","hash":"_configuration_settings","id":4},{"text":"Problems","hash":"_problems","id":5},{"text":"Trivia","hash":"_trivia","id":6}]},"212":{"id":212,"text":"Using the UKHO API predictions of HW/LW for over 600 tidal stations around the UK are possible.

Then “Apply. After successful installation, the plugin should be available in the plugins tab of your OpenCPN options dialog box. Then close Options and the two Play and Record VDR Icons should appear in the Toolbar. Record and Play the Nmea0183 data stream in OpenCPN. Use VDR for AIS Simulation - Run VDR to play AIS NMEA files. Or… use the VDR plugin to record your passages and replay them later! The VDR is also great for testing NMEA sentences, the Dashboard and new OpenCPN features. These are just a few examples, of how to use this versatile plugin. When VDR is activated in ToolBar→Options→Plugins→VDR, two Buttons appear in the ToolBar. The left button is for recording, and leads to a “Choose file” dialog to select the file to record to. A file with a .txtfile extension works well. The right button is for playing an existing file, and also leads to a dialog where the file must be selected. Once selected VDR starts to play the file,the small dialog below shows on the screen. You can control the speed with the upper slider. Far left is slow, natural speed, while moving the slider to the far right equals fast forwarding. Please note that the setting under options/ships/calculate SOG will impact which SOG values are shown when playing fast forwarding. The lower part of the dialog shows the progress. When recording, the VDR plugin includes all NMEA data available on the internal bus in OpenCPN. Even data not recognized or used by OpenCPN will be recorded. Everything (almost) in the ToolBar→Connections→NMEA debug window will be included. In other words. The VDR records everything from all ports and does not participate in the downstream multiplexer filter or priority scheme. That way, a VDR recording may be played back, experimenting with various filters and priorities if desired. If you are playing a file with the VDR at the same time, even that data will be included. So it is possible to play and record at the same time! To get started, download this file. Save and un-zip and you have a .txt file. The file is ready to play. * If you can’t find the boat, have a look in the Adriatic or just press the “Auto Follow”, or press F2. The view will now center on the action.

This plugin allows satellite charts from Google, Bing or Nokia to be downloaded via the VentureFarther server https://www.venturefarther.com Even in well charted areas such as the UK the satellite chart will often be more accurate than the official UKHO chart. As an example a waypoint was made on the chart for the River Avon, Devon, UK. An extreme example but the satellite chart shows where you could have ended up if you had followed the navigation chart! You will need to register with VentureFarther and obtain your API key here Please read the 'Credits' page on the VentureFarther website. 1 Credit is used for each single satellite chart download. Making a 'Multi-Chart' download will use 9 credits, because it consists of 9 satellite charts. Credits can be earned by submitting cruising information or you may choose to purchase an annual subsciption.

If one of your 'normal' navigational chart directories contains encrypted charts, such as those from VisitMyHarbour you will find that any satellite charts you create are deleted as soon as OpenCPN is closed. To avoid this you will need to remove the encrypted chart directory. Close OpenCPN and restart. Make your satellite charts. You can then close OpenCPN. VisitMyHarbour (VMH) charts are activated … 'I agree'. Start OpenCPN and add your VMH chart directory. You then have both satellite charts and VMH charts on the same screen.

Watchdog communicates with another very useful plug-in, called Ocpn_Draw. Ocpn_Draw (OD) is used to draw points, lines and shapes, guard zones and boundaries which can be used in navigation to show Electronic bearing lines (EBL) Variable range markers (VRM) Specific points (Boundary-points) Specific areas (Boundaries) Special boundary which moves with the boat (Guard Zone) These features of Ocpn_Draw (OD) must be made using Ocpn_Draw, so they can be used in Watchdog. Watchdog can alert you when your own ship enters (or gets too close to) or leaves (or gets too far away from) one or more of these stationary Boundaries. Watchdog can also provide an alert when another ship (AIS-target) enters a Guard Zone Boundary(moving with your ship). Watchdog and Ocpn_Draw work together using boundary identifiers called GUID to provide some very useful alarms. Watchdog will be referred to as \"WD\". Ocpn_Draw will be referred to as \"OD\". The plugin was originally named \"Watchman\" but was later renamed to \"Watchdog\" which might seen in some screens and menu’s. Watchdog is available as a managed plugin (PIM), which is the easiest way to install the plugin. The OpenCPN Manual has general information in Plugin Download, Install and Enable for installing this plugin. This is the preferred way. In OpenCPN, go to the Options → Plugins and download, install and enable the Watchdog plugin. In OpenCPN Click Tools-Options-Plugins First \"Update\" the master plugins catalog. Select the Watchdog entry and \"Install\" the plugin. In the list of installed plugins \"Enable\" the Tactics plugin and \"Apply\". Use “Preferences” to set your preferences (should be self-explanatory). Then “Apply. After successful installation, the plugin should be available in the plugins tab of your OpenCPN options dialog box. Then close Options and the Watchdog Icon should appear in the Toolbar. The second way is to download a PI Package Installer (Windows .exe, Linux .deb or MacOS .pkg) from the OpenCPN website, to download Watchdog Then Click \"Downloads\" These instructions are specifically for WD-pi, however the OpenCPN Manual has more general information using this older method in Plugin Download, Install and Enable. Click \"Plugins for OpenCPN 4.2 and up\" Scroll down to the \"Safety\" section and click \"WatchDog\" Choose the file compatible with your computer. These examples are for Windows, so we choose the Windows setup-package. Download the file (double-click). Install the Package It’s better to close OpenCPN before installing WD-pi. We assume you know where to find the files you download from the Internet. Open the downloaded Plugin Package Installer (watchdog_pi[version].exe) and install the plugin following these screenshots (don’t mind the dutch). Accept the license terms and install the plugin. Then before using WD-pi enable the plug-in. Open OpenCPN, Click Tools - Options Click Plugins Scroll to Watchdog plugin and click Enable Click OK Now the Watchdog-icon should be visible in your OpenCPN toolbar Watchdog warns you -in specific situations- when you want to be warned. Watchdog has the following alarms: Landfall Alarm Boundary Alarm GPS Course Cross Boundary Alarm GPS Fix NM from Boundary Alarm AIS GUARD & Inclusion Guard Zone Alarm Anchor Alarm Course Alarm Speed Alarm Depth Alarm* Wind Alarm* Weather Alarm* Pypilot Alarm* Deadman Alarm NMEA No Data Alarm* Email Alert New alarms are noted with an asterick * Does it bark? Yes, that is possible. But maybe you want to choose something else. You can set an alert in the form of a text-message that pops up on your screen …. (in the pop-up screen there’s still evidence of the original name Watchman..) A text-message is rather useless if you are not looking at your display. The Deadman alarm prevents the watchman from falling asleep (or wakes up) so this alert is logically a loud noise. So Watchdog also enables you to set an acoustic alarm. You can use any sound you like, as long as it is a \".wav\" file. Examples: If you want to brush up on your Morse-code, you can set Morse-code YYY (Yankee = \"My anchor is dragging\") as sound for anchorwatch-alarm and Morse-code UUU (Uniform = \"You are running into danger\") as the sound for Boundary and Land-fall-alarm. You can generate these sounds yourself dead-simple on the website Morse Code Translator. Just type whatever you want, adjust pitch and speed to your liking and save as .wav files in /OpenCPN/sounds). If your only reaction to hearing the beeps of Morse code is \"Ah, the pizza in the microwave is ready!\" then maybe a more direct approach suits you better. Perhaps a computer that actually says \"Warning! Boundary!\" when the Boundary-alarm sounds and \"Warning! Anchor!\" when your anchor is dragging. In a \"Edit Alarm\" Menu browse to '%localappdata\"\\watchdog_pi\\data\\Warnings\\Warning Boundary.wav' %localappdata\\opencpn\\plugins\\watchdog_pi\\data\\Warnings OR C:\\Users\\Rick\\AppData\\Local\\opencpn\\plugins\\watchdog_pi\\data\\Warnings and pick an appropriate Warning. Then \"Test\" to confirm the path is correct.. _ _ Use a sound command line utility to play sound files. Another way to play Watchdog Warnings with \"Sound\" unchecked and \"Command\" checked. Then try these examples using Powershell for Win OS: powershell -c (New-Object Media.SoundPlayer 'C:\\Program Files(x86)\\OpenCPN 5.2.4+6b314e6\\sounds\\2bells.wav').PlaySync(); OR powershell -c (New-Object Media.SoundPlayer 'C:\\Users\\Rick\\AppData\\Local\\opencpn\\plugins\\watchdog_pi\\data\\Warnings\\Warning\\Boundary.wav').PlaySync(); The paths are: %localappdata%\\opencpn\\plugins\\watchdog_pi\\data\\Warnings\\ and then [add the appropriate filename] OR C:\\Users\\[user]\\AppData\\Local\\opencpn\\plugins\\watchdog_pi\\data\\Warnings[appropriate file name] If you really want a Watchdog that barks, then find a wav-file of a barking dog, it might start every dog nearby to join in. Apart from pop-up screens and all kinds of sounds, you can also let Watchdog execute a computer command. That can be any computer command. To name just a few options: Start a pdf-document with pre-defined messages in \"Seaspeak\" or any other language you need to have a conversation with the skipper of that monstrosity that is About to collide with you. Or imagine your boat anchored in the bay and you sitting ashore in the pub….. And hey, on our mobile phone we receive an email from a loved-one! How this email-trick is done, is explained in \"Email Alert to yourself\" at the end of this manual. When Watchdog is installed and in the OpenCPN Toolbar, follow these 4 initial steps to set up a new Watchdog Alarm: Step 1. Click \"Watchdog\" in the OpenCPN Toolbar* Step 2. The \"Watchdog Window\" opens. If no alarms are set, it will be a rather empty screen. Place the cursor in that empty screen. A mouse-click will give you a pull-down menu. Step 3. Click \"New\" Step 4. The \"New Alarm Window\" opens. It shows the various types of alarms. Note: This window might still have a small bug. I cannot adjust it’s size and so the text in the “Cancel”-button is just “anc”….. This manual was written with the Windows-version of OpenCPN and Watchdog. In Linux Mint it works better. In the Linux-version of OpenCPN and Watchdog you can adjust the size of the window so that all options are shown. (The next steps involve clicking the desired alarm and clicking \"OK\") NOTE: These 4 initial steps are the same for each alarm. In the rest of this tutorial these steps will not be repeated but will be referred to as \"set up a new Watchdog-alarm\". When setting up a new Watchdog-alarm, you will come across the “Edit Alarm” window. In that window there is a part (normally the uppermost part) that is specific for that type of alarm, but there is also a part that is the same for every type of alarm. It is the “Alarm Action” part. In several alarms you’ll see in the \"Alarm Action\" part a checkbox “Alarm if no Data”. That is because most WD-alarms are based upon information (“data”) your computer is getting from other devices. For instance: GPS for position, speed and course, digital wind-sensor, digital sensors for air-pressure, temperature and humidity,an AIS-receiver or transponder etc. If that box is checked, the alarm will be activated when the data-stream is interrupted. For instance: anchor alarm is set to be activated when you drift more than 50 metres from your position. Your position is given by your GPS-receiver. If the “Alarm if no Data” - checkbox is checked and the GPS stops working, the alarm will be activated, even if your ship hasn’t drifted at all. That checkbox is an important safety-feature because it will warn you when one of your instruments has gone on the blink and has stopped sending it’s information! In the Edit Alarm-window you can tell Watchdog what you want it to do. A brief explanation: Sound Alert you by playing the soundfile (.wav-file) you have entered (use the “Browse” button to point WD to that file). Command Execute a computer command (type the command in the box next to “command”). Message Box Show a pop-up Textbox with “ALARM”. Repeat Alarm after seconds Gives the opportunity to order WD to repeat the alarm after a set time (in this example that time is set to “60 seconds”). Automatically Reset Means that when the alarm is triggered, the alarm will be reset to await the next “cause for alarm”. Graphics Enabled Means that WD will show you something on screen, relating to the alarm. For instance the radius of the anchor-alarm you have set. Test Means that you can test if the alarm works yes or no. Information Means that … well, try that button for yourself and you’ll see. If you do not understand the function of the buttons “OK” and/or “Cancel”: sell your computer! First the various types of alarms are briefly explained. After that each type of alarm is explained in (a bit) more detail. Short Alarm Descriptions below. Landfall Alarm alerts when own ship nears land. Most useful for long voyages with vast stretches of water. More extensive description of the alarm LANDFALL ALARM. See also Plugin Messaging between ODraw, Watchdog and Weather_routing. Boundary Alarm alerts when own ship’s position relative to a Boundary is not within ranges set or when about to sail into a \"restricted area\". The manual for Boundary Alarm is a bit more complex than the other sections. That is because: there can be different types of boundaries (made with the plugin O-DRAW) and there can be different types of boundary-alarms (made with WATCHDOG). With Watchdog you can make 4 different types of boundary-alarms: GPS course-alarm warns when course and speed will cross the perimeter (border) of a boundary in less than the specified time. In this manual this type of alarm is also referred to as \"Boundary-time\". GPS fix-alarm warns when position from the perimeter (border) of a boundary is less than the given distance. In this manual this type of alarm is also referred to as \"Boundary-distance\". Inclusion-alarm warns when own ship is outside a given boundary. AIS Guard Zone-alarm warns when other ships are inside a given boundary. Boundary-alarms of the type GPS course, GPS fix and Inclusion are related to the position (and speed and course) of your own ship and are fed by the data from your GPS receiver. Note: \"Inclusion Alarm\" might be a bit confusing because \"inclusion\" means \"beïng inside or included in a boundary\". The \"Inclusion Alarm\" is not intended to alarm when own ship gets inside a boundary. On the contrary, it is intended to alarm when own ship gets outside the boundary. In earlier versions of Watchdog this alarm was called \"Anchor Watch Boundary GUID\". But as Watchdog also has a dedicated \"Anchor Watch\" alarm, the name was changed into \"Inclusion\" Alarm. To avoid \"inclusion-confusion\" 8-O , just keep in mind that the \"Inclusion Alarm\" is keeping an eye on you to make sure your \"own ship\" stay \"included\" in the boundary.\" The more extensive description of the alarm is here: BOUNDARY ALARM. This alarm will be triggered when course and speed will bring you in less than (user defined) minutes to a boundary. The more extensive description is here: GPS COURSE Cross Boundary. This is an alarm when the ship reaches a user specified distance (NM) from a Boundary. The more extensive description is here: GPS FIX NM from Boundary. A Boundary alarm of the type AIS Guard Zone is triggered by the data from other ships, as received by your AIS receiver. The difference with the \"normal\" AIS alarm (warn me when a ship comes within a given distance from \"own ship\") is that the Watchdog Boundary Guard Zone alarm gets triggered when a ship enters a specific area (like for instance the entrance to that secluded spot you thought to have for just you and your spouse/friend/secretary/…). The more extensive description of the alarm is here: AIS GUARD & Inclusion. Note: in Watchdog you can set a \"Guard Zone\" alarm but in O-Draw you can also create a \"Guard Zone\". A Guard Zone in O-Draw is a special kind of area that is not static, but moves with your own ship. The more extensive description is here: DYNAMIC GUARD ZONES. Anchor Alarm alerts when your position changes more than a specific distance from a certain position (when your anchor is dragging). The more extensive description of the alarm is here: ANCHOR ALARM. Course Alarm is alerts when \"own ship\" gets off course. The more extensive description of the alarm is here: COURSE ALARM. Speed Alarm alerts when boat speed drops below a set speed (Underspeed) or when boat speed has increased above a set speed (Overspeed), both can be problematical. The more extensive description of the alarm is here: SPEED ALARM. Depth alerts when depth is less than a user set depth. The more extensive description of the alarm is here: DEPTH ALARM. The wind-alarm can be set to warn when the windspeed exceeds a given value, drops under a given value or changes direction. The more extensive description of the alarm is here: WIND ALARM. Weather-alarm alerts when there are changes in barometric pressure, air temperature, sea temperature, relative humidity and humidity. Which helps to decide what to wear, foul-weather or bathing suit, and of course to decide when to head for a safe haven. The more extensive description of the alarm is here: WEATHER ALARM. The Pypilot-alarm alerts when something is wrong with your automatic steering gear (autopilot), driven by the Pypilot plugin. The more extensive description of the alarm is here: PYPILOT ALARM . Deadman Alarm alerts when there is no keyboard activity (fallen asleep, jumped overboard or simply passed away). The alert occurs after a given amount of time the program still has not experienced any input, to be sure there is still someone on watch. The Deadman alarm stops as soon as any user action is taken, for instance a movement of the cursor (mouse). The more extensive description of the alarm is here: DEADMAN ALARM. NMEA Data Alarm alerts hen OpenCPN loses NMEA-input. NMEA-data is information the program receives from various instruments. Most well-known NMEA-data is from GPS receivers and AIS receivers. NMEA Data Alarm is crucial if you want to rely on instruments for position, course and speed or AIS! In short: if NMEA input is lost a significant part of OpenCPN is lost. The more extensive description of the alarm NMEA DATA ALARM. For any of the alarms, send an email alert. EMAIL ALERT. Landfall-alarm is meant to alert you when you get within a set distance from land. For most sailors the usefulness of such an alert is obvious. \"Hoorah and up she rises!\" More info: go to \"MAIB\" and search for \"Lysblink Seaways\". Important: the alarm operates in relation to the coastline as it is programmed into your vector charts! OpenCPN comes with a worldwide background map, displayed if no charts are available for an area. Note: these two screenshots illustrate that the coastline in that basic background map can be quite different from the real thing! Looking at this basic coastline chart WD will assume we are not close enough to the coastline to trigger the Landfall alarm. So, WD stays quiet. When he really should have barked! Therefore it would be advisable to use the 224mb(unzipped), most detailed, GSHHS High Resolution Background Map. It can be downloaded using the Chart Downloader Stay on the safe side and set landfall-alarm for a distance well offshore. Landfall-alarm is not meant for close-quarters navigation. Setting the Landfall-alarm is explained step-by-step by these screenshots. Set up a new Watchdog-alarm and pick \"Landfall\". Click \"OK\". The \"Edit Alarm\" window pops up. In the Edit Alarm window you can choose between \"GPS course crosses land in less than … minutes\" or \"GPS fix is less than …. nm from coastline\". Here we’ve chosen \"GPS fix is less than 5 nm from coastline\". Tick the rest of the boxes and click \"OK\". The Watchdog Configuration window shows the alarm. Now your Landfall alarm is ready to be used. Just make sure the \"Alarm On/Alarm Off\" box is ticked (set). Watchdog communicates with another very useful plug-in, called \"OpenCPN ODraw Plugin\". That plugin is a tool to draw geo-referenced points, lines and shapes within OpenCPN. These points, lines and shapes can be used in navigation, for instance to show specific points or areas (Boundaries), electronic bearing lines (EBL) and variable range markers (VRM). Watchdog will be referred to as \"WD-pi\" or \"WD\". OpenCPN Draw Plugin will be referred to as \"Ocpn-Draw\", \"ODraw-pi\" or \"OD\". This section of the Watchdog-manual is a bit more complex than the other sections because: With O-DRAW you can make 4 different types of boundary. Boundary-type \"inclusion\" Boundary-type \"exclusion\" Boundary-type \"neither\" Guard Zone a special kind of boundary: With WATCHDOG you can make 4 different types of Boundary-alarms. GPS course crosses boundary in less than … minutes GPS fix is less than … nautical miles from boundary Inclusion Alarm, Boundary GUID ….. AIS Guard Zone, Boundary GUID ….. There can be several combinations of boundary type and boundary alarm. Before we continue, an explanation of these 4 different types of alarms is needed. GPS course-alarm warns you when your course and speed will make you cross the perimeter (border) of a boundary in less than the specified time. In this manual this type of alarm is also referred to as \"Boundary-time\". GPS fix-alarm warns you when your position from the perimeter (border) of a boundary is less than the given distance. In this manual this type of alarm is also referred to as \"Boundary-distance\". Inclusion-alarm warns you when you are outside a given boundary (a bit like \"Anchor Alarm\"). AIS Guard Zone-alarm warns you when other ships are inside a given boundary. WD and OD are independent plugins but the two can work together by passing and receiving messages. For the alarms, when WD needs boundary information, WD asks OD, via a message, whether a Lat/Lon is inside a boundary. WD can add further requirements asking for boundaries in a particular state and a particular type. Both the state and type are the same as what OD uses, i.e. Active/Inactive and Exclusion/Inclusion/Neither, or the inclusive \"Any\" (meaning any type and/or any state, not being as selective). To fully benefit from the capabilities of the WD Boundary Alarms, we need to understand the \"Boundaries\" made by OD. For a full explanation, see the Ocpn-Draw_pi in the manual. You can create Boundaries in (OD) Ocpn_Draw_pi (not Watchdog) by clicking \"Create Boundary\" and Guard-Zones by clicking \"Create Guard Zone\", explained in the Draw-pi section of this manual. Boundary Types In Ocpn_Draw_pi (OD) Create a boundary In \"Boundary Properties\" tab, assign a \"Boundary Type\" to each Boundary or Boundary Point (BP) Choose \"Exclusion\", \"Inclusion\" or \"Neither\" In WD set the alarm type for every kind of boundary. Set alarms that are triggered when own ship gets too close to a boundary of type \"Exclusion\", Set alarms triggered when own ship gets too close to an \"Inclusion\" boundary or a \"Neither\" setting. The most logical boundaries use is \"Inclusion\" boundaries are like a play pen, \"OK to be inside\", \"Exclusion\" boundaries are fencing an area out and \"not OK to be inside\" \"Neither\" boundaries are just good to be alerted when crossed. The message from each type of boundary is: Exclusion \"Don’t come near or inside.\" BOAT KEEP OUT Inclusion \"Stay inside.\" KEEP BOAT INSIDE. Neither Location is not important, Alert when crossing is important. Each Boundary Type is graphically represented in a specific way. Exclusion: a hatched pattern inside the area. Inclusion: a hatched zone on the outside of the boundary. Neither: no hatch (just a line). Boundaries can be any shape, size and color you like, for color its logical to use red (\"danger\") for boundaries of the type \"exclusion\" and something green(\"safe\") for boundaries of the type \"inclusion\". This screenshot shows the different types of boundaries. Top row: two boundaries of the type \"inclusion\" Second row: three boundaries of the type \"exclusion\" Third row: two boundaries of the type \"neither\" Fourth row: three boundary points. From left to right, \"inclusion\", \"exclusion\"and \"neither\". Setting up a \"GPS COURSE CROSSES BOUNDARY IN < …​.MINUTES\" ALARM Set up a new Watchdog-alarm and pick “Boundary”. Select \"GPS course crosses boundary in < …. minutes\" Edit the alarm so that the alarm will be triggered when course and speed will bring you in less than (your choice) minutes to a boundary. You can set the time between 0 and 1000 minutes. 0 minutes is quite useless and 1000 minutes (more than 16 hours) is maybe a bit much. In this example we have used 20 minutes. In the Watchdog \"Edit Alarm\" window, you can select \"Boundary Type\" and \"Boundary State\". In this example \"Any\" and \"Active\" are ticked. The result is that the alarm will look at all active boundaries, no matter what the type is. Regarding the type of the boundary: If you’d like the alarm to react to * any boundary, no matter what the type is, select \"Any\". * only to boundaries of the type \"Exclusion\", select \"Exclusion\". * only to boundaries of the type \"Inclusion\", select \"Inclusion\". * only to boundaries of the type \"Neither\", select \"Neither\". Regarding the state of the boundary: If you’d like the alarm to react to * any boundary, no matter what the state is, select \"Any\". * only to active boundaries, select \"Active\". * only to inactive boundaries, select \"Inactive\". Note: as from WD version 1.9025 the \"Edit Alarm\" window for Boundary alarm also shows a slider to allow the user to select the frequency of checking. It defaults to 3 seconds (the current Watchdog default), but can be set from 1 to 120 seconds. The longer the check the better for low powered machines. Don’t forget to set the Alarm Actions (\"Sound\", \"Message Box\" etc. as described in \"Standard actions: Setting up the Alarm Actions\"). Click \"OK\". To illustrate the working of the alarm, in this example we have set the COG Predictor Length to 20 minutes (via Options-Ships-Own Ship-Display Options). As long as we are more than 20 minutes away from a boundary, Watchdog will remain silent. But as soon as we are less than 20 minutes away from a boundary, the alarm will be triggered. Setting up a \"GPS FIX IS < …… NM FROM BOUNDARY\"​ ALARM Set up a new Watchdog-alarm ​ and pick “Boundary”. Select \"GPS fix is < …..nm from boundary\"​ Edit the alarm ​ so that the alarm will be triggered when the GPS fix indicates that the boat is less than the minimum distance from a boundary. Entering a distance of \"0\", the alarm will not work because that is \"a distance of less than 0 nm\" In this example we have chosen 0.01 nm (18,5 meters) to a boundary (\"GPS fix is < 0.01 nm from boundary). Note: In this example we have a boundary of the type \"exclusion\" (a hatch-pattern on the inside). In the Watchdog \"Edit Alarm\" window, you can select \"Boundary Type\" and \"Boundary State\". In this example \"Exclusion\" and \"Active\" are ticked with the result that the alarm will only consider \"Exclusion\" and \"Active\" boundaries. (See also the previous section (\"Setting up a GPS course crosses boundary in < …. minutes\") for the effects of ticking the different \"Boundary Type\" and \"Boundary State\"-buttons). Don’t forget to set the Alarm Action and click OK. Now lets see if it works…. As long as the distance to a boundary is more than 0.01 nm, the alarm remains silent. But as soon as we get within a distance of 0.01 nm of a boundary, the alarm is triggered The alarm will also show the name and description of the boundary you are getting too close to. For this example that name is \"Testboundary-01-Exclusion-STAY OUT\". This goes also for the inner side of the boundary. Closer than 0.01 nm from the boundary perimeter? Alarm. More than 0.01 nm from the perimeter? The alarm stops. Watchdog did warn you, but if you still decide to go on, she (yes, Watchdog is a bitch…. ;-) ) will assume that you know what you are doing. A Boundary alarm of the type “Inclusion Alarm” is meant to alert you when your own ship gets outside a specific boundary. The alarm is related to the position of your own ship and is fed by the NMEA-data from your GPS receiver. A Boundary alarm of the type “Guard Zone” is meant to alert you when one or more other ships are inside a specific boundary. “Guard Zone” is related to the position of other ships and is fed by the NMEA-data from your AIS receiver. \"Guard Zone\" will also be shortened to \"GZ\". NOTE: “other ships” are only ships that actually transmit AIS data and whose AIS-data are actually received by your AIS receiver! Ships that do not transmit AIS-data (or AIS-data your AIS receiver does not receive) are not “seen” by WD! Keep this in mind, especially as you might encounter ships that should send out AIS-signals, but don’t do so because their transmitter is switched off on purpose (like fishing vessels that want to keep their favourite fishing tracks hidden from others!) To let Watchdog know what specific boundary it has to guard, you have to specify the “GUID” of that boundary. GUID stands for “globally unique identifier” and is a unique reference number used as an identifier in computer software. GUIDs are displayed as 32 hexadecimal digits with groups separated by hyphens. Example: 2a980000-5098-4787-ac4f-e05b47e7ffff To enter the GUID of a Boundary or BP in WD, you place your mouse-cursor on a boundary, do a right-mouseclick and copy the GUID. Then, in the Watchdog Edit Alarm-window, you can paste the GUID in the field Boundary GUID or Guard Zone GUID. Make sure you do \"Copy GUID\" before editing the Watchdog Alarm. Alternatively, when the “own ship” icon is within the boundary, you can click “Get Boundary GUID”. Note: this method does not always work. In such cases: use the “copy-paste” method. Set up a new Watchdog-alarm and pick “Boundary”. Select “AIS Guard Zone” Edit the alarm so that the alarm will be coupled to the boundary you want to be guarded. Don’t forget to set the Alarm Action and click OK. Now lets see if it works…. As soon as the feed from your AIS receiver shows that an AIS-target (=“another ship”) enters the specified Guard Zone Boundary, the alarm gets triggered. The other ship (green icon) is not (yet) in the Guard Zone Boundary: alarm not triggered (yet). The ship enters the Guard Zone Boundary: Guard Zone Alarm is triggered (and shows ships name and MMSI-number). And the text in the Watchdog window turns red and says “AIS Target in zone” As soon as the ship leaves the Guard Zone Boundary: Alarm is not triggered anymore. The text in the Watchdog Window turns back to black and says “No AIS targets found in zone”. The Boundary AIS Guard Zone Alarm works! Setting up a Boundary Inclusion Alarm is similar to setting up a Boundary Guard Zone alarm. But instead of \"Guard Zone\" you click “Inclusion Alarm” and you put the GUID of the “Inclusion Alarm\" Boundary in the field next to “Boundary GUID”. Set up a new Watchdog-alarm and pick “Boundary”. Select “Inclusion Alarm” Edit the alarm so that the alarm will be coupled to the boundary you want to \"stay inside\" of. In this example it is a boundary with GUID 6372ffff-7f0e-4a64-9e6c-dfd303620000 Don’t forget to set the Alarm Action and click OK. Now lets see if it works…. The own ship is inside the boundary. Watchdog watches over you and wants you to stay \"included\". Well, in this case everything is just fine. Watchdog stays silent. The text in the Watchdog window stays black. But as soon as our ship leaves the boundary, Watchdog alerts us! And the text in the Watchdog window turns red. The \"Boundary Inclusion\" alarm works! It is possible to assign a Boundary Guard Zone Alarm and a Boundary Inclusion Alarm to one and the same boundary. That means that you can let Watchdog alert you: when another ship enters your “safe” anchoring area when you are drifting out of that area. To achieve this, you use in the Boundary Guard Zone Alarm the same GUID as in the Boundary Inclusion Alarm. You can activate one of the two alarms, both of them or none of them. In this screenshot both alarms are activated. The plugin \"Ocpn_Draw\" was invaluable to begin with, but got even better when it was updated with the possibility to draw a Guard Zone that moves with our own ship! Guard Zones differ from normal Boundaries, they move with your own ship and can rotate with the ships heading or with the ship’s course over the ground. Let’s call them \"Dynamic Guard Zones\". As oDraw works hand in glove with WATCHDOG, these new features in oDraw also affect the way WATCHDOG can be used. Here are some examples. In these examples \"Guard Zone\" is shortened to \"GZ\". Let’s assume that our ship has a blind spot. A blind spot is an area around the ship that cannot be directly observed by the helms(wo)man. In this example the blind spot is on the port side and extends from 70 to 90 degrees. We want to be alerted if any ship (AIS-target that is) enters that blind spot. We can set up Watchdog to do that for us. First set up a GZ Guard Zone. Open the Draw Toolbar Click \"Create GZ\" Set the first point of the GZ roughly abeam on the port side. Set the second point a bit above and to the right of the first point (clockwise). The result is some kind of wedge-shaped GZ. Now you should fine-tune that GZ. Click on the GZ and open the \"Properties\" tab. Give your GZ a recognizable name and description. Choose the Colours and Line Width you prefer and fill in the required angles and distances. See the example. Note: the first distance is the distance closest to the boat. Make sure this distance is bigger than 0. In this example the first distance is set to 0.01 NMi or 18.52 meters. The second distance is the greatest distance from the boat. In this example that distance is set to 1.25 NMi. As the blind spot extends from 70 to 90 degrees portside, we set the first angle to -95 (- is port, + is starboard) and the second angle to -70. The result is a wedge-shaped GZ that starts at 0.01 NMi, extends to 1.25 NMi and covers 15 degrees. Make sure you put a checkmark at \"Rotate with Boat\"!! The next step is to set up a Watchdog Guard Zone Alarm for that GZ. The steps to do that are described earlier in this manual. Now we’ll put it to the test. The Highland Challenger is closing in on our portside. but as soon as she challenges our \"slice of pie\", Watchdog starts to alert us! Some other examples: A GZ that extends from 90 degrees Port to 90 degrees starboard. The outer perimeter is 1.50 NMi, the inner perimeter is 1.25 NMi. The four range rings around our own ship are set 0.25 NMi apart. Eurocargo Genova is approaching on our port bow. Still more than 1.5 miles away, but she’s a big one and doing almost 20 knots. Luckily we’ve set up our GZ alarm. A \"Tri-colour\" GZ. Here we have three GZ’s around the ship. One (red) covering the 112.5 degree arc that coincides with the port navigation light, one (green) covering the 112.5 degree arc that coincides with the starboard navigation light and one (white) covering the 135 degree arc that coincides with the stern light. As all of these GZ’s are set up to rotate with the ship’s heading, they could be used to see at one glance whether another ship is in your red, green or white sector (also handy to remind some of us that \"starboard is green and port is red\"…..). In this example the sectors range from 0.10 to 0.25 Nmi from our ship. This is how these three GZ’s (Guardzone Port, Guardzone Starboard and Guardzone Stern) are set up: The red sector: The green sector: The white sector: Note that the white sector is set by defining the first angle as 112.50 and the second angle as -112.50 this covers an arc of 135 degrees (360-225). Arco Axe is sneaking up on us. GZ \"Stern\" is activated. We really don’t want Arco Axe (or any other axe for that matter….) to hit us in the behind but before she can become a pain in the ass, Watchdog spots her and alerts us. You can set up multiple Dynamic Guard Zones and set the alarms for one, some or all of these zones. (Dynamic) Guard Zone Alarms are in some ways similar to the \"AIS Collision Alarm\" you can set in OpenCPN (Options-Ships-AIS Targets-CPA Calculation). But they are more versatile. The Anchor Alarm does not belong to the catgory \"Boundary\" as it is not related to a boundary. The Anchor Alarm is related to a specific position. The pictures are self-explaining (or at least supposed to be).Set up a new watchdog alarm and pick \"Anchor In the \"Edit Alarm\" window, the latitude and longitude (Lat and Lon) of your ship wil be shown (or to be precise: the Lat and Lon of the \"your ship\" cursor, so make sure you have a GPS fix!). Radius can be set to whatever you like but \"0 meters\" will of course result in an unwanted amount of alarms. In this example radius is set to 50 meters. Click \"OK\". Then the alarm is enabled and the boat is within the radius of 50 meters from the specified position, the alarm is not triggered and the circle showing that radius has a green edge. Moving the boat more than the pre-set radius (in this case 50 meters), triggers the alarm. The green edge turns red. The text in the WD window turns red and shows the distance from the specified position. To Stop False Alarms (Hints): Set the Anchor Alert at the same time and place as the Anchor! - As close as possible. Set the radius a little larger. Make sure you have set the anchor properly so it is not dragging and there is adequate scope. Anchor out of kelp in good holding ground. Change your anchor location, shallower or deeper, different bottom. Check your GPS NMEA data stream to see if the GPS signal is reasonably constant. To check your GPS Data Stream In the NMEA debug window, do you see changes in the GPS receiver position reported by RMC or GLL messages? You can save this stream as a file using the VDR plugin and inspect it with a Text Editor. Make sure there is no change in position reported by GPS receiver. Look at the RMC lines. The lat and lon fields are constant. EG: \"3348.0358\" and \"15116.9019\". You will need to watch these values for a longer time to see change. Of course, if you cycle the power on the GPS receiver, you may see a change, particularly if the receiver selects a different set of satellites to calculate the position. When this happens, by the way, it is a reminder of the essential limit of GPS positional accuracy. You are getting 3 digits of precision, implying around 6 feet of accuracy. But consumer-grade GPS is generally not repeatably accurate to 6 ft. Course Alarm is (of course) meant to alert you when you get off course. The problem with getting off course is that you might end up somewhere where you do not want to be. Setting the Course-alarm is explained step-by-step by these screenshots. Set up a new watchdog alarm and pick \"Course\" You can set the alarm for, for \"Port\" only, for \"Starboard\" only or for \"Port or Starboard\". Choose \"Port\" if you only want to be alarmed when you go too far to port. Choose \"Starboard\" if you only want to be alarmed when you go too far to starboard. Choose \"Port or Starboard\" if you want to be alarmed when you go either too far to port or too far to starboard. Choose how many degrees you want as margin before the alarm is triggered. You can specify the desired course either manually (enter the desired course yourself) or by clicking \"Current Course\". In that case Watchdog enters your present COG, as received from your GPS. In this example Watchdog will start barking when you wander more than 20 degrees to port or more than 20 degrees to starboard from a course of 135 degrees. After you are finished editing the alarm, click \"OK\". The \"Course Alarm\" shows up in the Watchdog Configuration window. Click \"OK\". Watchdog shows your COG (in this example 168 degrees). Tick the checkbox (if it isn’t ticked yet). Watchdog \"Course Alarm\" is now activated and wil alert you if your course is not between 115 and 155 degrees (135 plus or minus 20 degrees). In the screenshot below the course is somewhere around 005 degrees. As that is (way) off course, the alarm is triggered. Speed-alarm is meant to alert you when your SOG gets below (Underspeed) or above (Overspeed) a specific speed. You can set a limit. That limit is the speed, in knots, you don’t want to get below or above. Setting the Speed-alarm is explained step-by-step by these screenshots. Set up a new watchdog alarm and pick \"Speed\" In this example the alarm is set for \"Underspeed\" and set to 5 knots, because you want an alert when speed drops below 5 knots. However when riding bigger waves, speed can increase momentarily when surfing and and decrease on reaching the bottom. In such cases the Speed Alarm might get triggered with every wave. To prevent alarm cycling, set Watchdog to average your speed. You can set a slider from 1 second to 120 seconds. In this example the slider is set to 60 seconds. Now Watchdog will only trigger the alarm when your average speed, measured over a period of 60 seconds, will be below 5 knots. In this example the boat’s average speed over 60 seconds was 0.6 knots and the limit was set to 5.0 knots. Watchdog shows you \"0.6 < 5.0\" (0.6 is less than 5.0). Here we have set two speed-alarms. One for Underspeed and one for Overspeed. In this screenshot the limit was still 5.0 knots, but the boat’s average speed over 60 seconds was 0.3 knots. The \"Underspeed\" alarm was triggered and the text turned red. The \"Overspeed\" alarm did not get triggered and that text remained black. Complete the detail and screenshots for this. The wind-alarm has three modes: Under Speed, Over Speed and Direction. So the alarm can be set to warn you when the windvelocity exceeds a given value (Over Speed), drops under a given velocity (Under Speed) or changes direction. Wind-alarm also has three types: Apparent - measured from moving boat (requires only wind sensors) True Relative - wind would feel like if boat stopped (requires windsensors + gps) True Absolute - wind would feel if boat stopped and faced north (requires wind sensors + gps + compass) The Weather-alarm can be used to warn you for changes in airpressure, air temperature, sea temperature, relative humidity and humidity. This is of course only possible if there are (digital) sensors for these parameters connected to OpenCPN. For the region of North Sea and Baltic Sea (40 - 60 degrees N) this table can be used as an indication: air-pressure change in hPa per hour air-pressure change in hPa per 3 hours expected windspeed in Bf +1,3 to +2 +4 to +6 6-7 +2 to +3 +6 to +9 8-9 more than +3 +10 or more 10 or more -1 to -2 -3 to -6 6-7 more than -2 more than -6 8-12 Note: In subtropic and tropic regions some of the above rules may not be valid at all! In tradewind- zones you should observe the daily variations: are they still present? If not: possible gale is to be expected. Let’s say you want to be warned when the barometer drops more than 1,3 hPa per hour. 1 hectopascal (hPa) is equal to 1 millibar (mBar). So 1,3 hPa per hour = 1.3 mBar per hour or 1.3 mBar per 3600 seconds. The setting in the WD-Weather-alarm would then be: Variable: Barometer Rate Type: Decreasing Value: 1.3 mBar In Last: 3600 Seconds Weathertips: Rapid pressure drop with no or almost no wind: sudden increase of windspeed / gale possible without any other sign! Weather front with rain coming before wind comes up: stronger winds are to be expected. Wind coming before rain: wind will probably not increase. Watchdog can be used in conjunction with the free software autopilot \"Pypilot\", wich is a separate plugin for OpenCPN. For more information on Pypilot, see the (separate) Pypilot manual In Watchdog there are several options to warn you for possible problems in the soft- or hardware of the Pypilot autopilot. Deadman Alarm alerts you (or your crew) when the watchman has fallen asleep, jumped overboard, after a set period of time the program has not had any user input. The objective is to assure someone is on watch. The Deadman alarm stops as soon as any action is taken, (movement of the mouse cursor). The only logical kind of alert for \"Deadman\" is some form of loud anannoying sound. Setting the Deadman-alarm is explained step-by-step by these screenshots. Set up a new watchdog alarm and pick \"Deadman\" Once set, the clock starts ticking. In Watchdog you can set NMEA-data-alarms. NMEA stands for National Marine Electronics Association. NMEA data consists of sentences, the first word of which, called a data type, defines the interpretation of the rest of the sentence. Each Data type would have its own unique interpretation and is defined in the NMEA standard. Examples of devices that communicate via NMEA-data with your computer are your GPS receiver and your AIS receiver. In this picture there is a set-up with a GPS receiver and a AIS receiver connected to OpenCPN. Here the GPS is on COM21 and the AIS on COM16. NMEA and your position. OpenCPN’s most important type of NMEA data is position, provided by your GPS receiver. Without receiving GPS data, OpenCPN loses own ship’s actual position. When GPS NMEA-data to OpenCPN stops, chartplotting and navigation stops. Own Ship might sail into a Boundary Area marked \"exclusion\", but the alarm won’t be triggered. Similar failures could occur with an Anchor Alarm. Dragging anchor will not trigger the alarm. It’s important to know when GPS fix is lost. GPS data is received as a data type beginning with \"$\" and the letters \"GP\". The most important NMEA data streams include the GGA sentence which provides the current Fix data, the RMC which provides the minimum GPS sentences information, and the GSA which provides the Satellite status data. So, if OpenCPN receives $GPGGA, that means it receives a fix from your GPS. Setting up a Watchdog-NMEA-alarm (GPS) Set up a Watchdog-NMEA-alarm that warns when the GPS fix is lost for more than 10 seconds. Set up a new watchdog alarm, choose \"NMEA Data\" and click \"OK Standard \"$GPGGA\" is set. Set timer to \"at least every 10 seconds\" and tick the other boxes as per the screenshot below. Click \"OK\" Now the NMEA-alarm set, and will be triggered 10 seconds after OpenCPN stops receiving GGA-sentences. NMEA and the position of other ships NMEA-data shows own ship location and where other ships are located (AIS), what their name, callsign, SOG and COG are etc. Good to have this data for a rendezvous or if you wish to avoid a collision. These kind of data are received via an AIS receiver. Multiple NMEA alarms You can set a separate alarm for the loss of AIS data. It works the same as the GPS alarm but AIS data (from other ships) always begin with !AIVDM (don’t forget the exclamation-mark). Setting up a Watchdog-NMEA-alarm (GPS) You can add a new NMEA-alarm (see the previous steps) but now you fill in !AIVDM The result is two NMEA Data-alarms (one for GPS fix and one for AIS-data) The upper NMEA Data alarm is the AIS-alarm. The lower NMEA Data alarm is the GPS alarm. Each alarm can be switched on or off. You can order Watchdog to execute a computer command. For example lets get Watchdog to send us an email in case our anchor drags. We have stored that command in a file we made and called AnchorAlarm.bat. In this example that file is stored in the root of our computer (C:\\) but of course you can put in anywhere, as long as you tell Watchdog where to find it. Sending emails from the command prompt can be done with a small tool called \"Send-It-Quiet\". More info: http://commandlinesendmail.blogspot.nl/ Example of the file AnchorAlarm.bat (in this example Send-It-Quiet is installed in E:\\Tools\\senditquiet\\senditquiet) Lets say: You are Blackbeard Your emailadress is blackbeard@gmail.com Your Gmail username is blackbeard Your Gmail password is 1loveGold2. You want the program to send an email to yourself with the subject ANCHOR ALARM and the message This is your ship. You stupid fool, come back here! My anchor is dragging! The batchfile would then be: E:\\Tools\\senditquiet\\senditquiet\\senditquiet.exe -s smtp.gmail.com -port 587 -u blackbeard@gmail.com -protocol ssl -p 1loveGold2 -f blackbeard@gmail.com -t blackbeard@gmail.com -subject \"ANCHOR ALARM\" -body \"This is your ship. You stupid fool, come back here! My anchor is dragging!\" The result when the anchor alarm gets triggered… Note Of course this only works when you can actually email from the computer OpenCPN is installed on! This example is tested on a Windows 7 PC with Internet connection and a Gmail-account. If, after reading all of the above, you still wonder why Watchdog could be of any use for navigation, we strongly advise you to sell your boat.","title":"WATCHDOG: Navigation Alarms","component":"watchdog","version":"","name":"index","url":"/watchdog/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Version & Changes","hash":"_version_changes","id":1},{"text":"Links","hash":"_links","id":2},{"text":"What is Watchdog (WD)?","hash":"_what_is_watchdog_wd","id":3},{"text":"Installation","hash":"_installation","id":4},{"text":"Using Plugin Manager (PIM)","hash":"_using_plugin_manager_pim","id":5},{"text":"Use Plugin Package Installer (PI)","hash":"_use_plugin_package_installer_pi","id":6},{"text":"How to enable WD-pi?","hash":"_how_to_enable_wd_pi","id":7},{"text":"A.

Source: https://github.com/seandepagnier/weatherfax_pi Maintenance Source: https://github.com/rgleason/weatherfax_pi Release: Windows Releases Download: https://opencpn.org/OpenCPN/plugins/weatherfax.html Forum: http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134/weatherfax-97533.html Weatherfax is available as a managed plugin (PIM), which is the easiest way to install the plugin. The OpenCPN Manual has general information in Plugin Download, Install and Enable for installing this plugin. This is the preferred way. In OpenCPN, go to the Options → Plugins and download, install and enable the Weatherfax plugin. In OpenCPN Click Tools-Options-Plugins First \"Update\" the master plugins catalog. Select the Weatherfax entry and \"Install\" the plugin. In the list of installed plugins \"Enable\" the Weatherfax plugin and \"Apply\". Use “Preferences” to set your preferences (should be self-explanatory). Then “Apply. After successful installation, the plugin should be available in the plugins tab of your OpenCPN options dialog box. Then close Options and the Weatherfax Icon should appear in the Toolbar. Then open it and explore the top menus. With an internet connection it is quite easy to select the “HF Radio Schedules” to select and set alarms for use with a receiver, or to select the Internet Schedules and then retrieve Weatherfaxes via the Internet and overlay on the chart. Audio Capture requires a connection. The second way is to download a Legacy PI Package Installer (Windows .exe, Linux .deb or MacOS .pkg) from the OpenCPN website, to download Weatherfax If you have an internet connection, first Retrieve > All > HF Radio Schedules. Then Retrieve > Internet > Select NOAA > Select Boston (for example) > Select 24hr 500mb Forecast The Weatherfax image file will download and be overlaid directly onto a chart. Lat 42 Long -70 –> Servers: Noaa —> Regions: Atlantic —→ Select Contents —→ Retrieve Lat 42 Long -70 –> Servers: Passage —> Regions: N. Atlantic —→ Select Contents —→ Retrieve It is a wonderful planning tool for cruises or passagemaking. There are several options, but * Select “Internet” to retrieve HF Radio Schedules via the internet. * Then Select “NOAA” Under “Servers” you will see “Stations” fill up. * Then select “Boston” and the Internet Retrieval choices are automatically listed in the menu area. * Select several faxes and pick “Retrieve Scheduled” or “Retrieve Selected”. Retrieve…Internet Select provider and region. Select forecast you need.(X) Highlight and use the 'Selected' button. The plugin data directory contains an WeatherFaxInternetRetrieval.xml file that has database for meterological sites. The “Internet Retrieval” Option uses this schedule. Aviation Americas Forecast retrieved via the internet. Passage Weather Atlantic 012 Wind via internet. Bermuda 3 day via internet. NOAA Atlantic 24hr 500mb via internet. NOAA Atlantic 24hr Surface via internet. Passage Weather New England Wind 012 Passage Weather Nova Scotia Wind 021 List of Weatherfaxes downloaded. Highlighted one shows overlaid on charts. The weatherfax will be overlayed generally in the proper location provided the weather service has not changed their fax formats. (The user can modify the associated WeatherFaxInternetRetrieval.xml file appropriately to add or modify the actions.) Users should please post changes to this file to the Weatherfax Thread for the next release. Please note tht all the loaded maps stay in RAM until OpenCPN is closed. RAM occupation depends on the maps size. The number of weatherfax charts that can be stored in memory is dependent on the amount of memory available. When weatherfax_pi runs out of available memory, it will stop downloading weatherfaxes. As soon as you close WxFax and restart this memory is cleared, however the previous images then no longer have active georeferencing, so you will need to download them again for automatic georeferencing. Weatherfax_pi keeps all downloaded images connected to its coordinates and georeferenced until that session of weatherfax is closed. For exemple on OpenCPN linux flatpak: Load 96 maps in Arome/France: 887MB Load 57 maps in Arpege/Europe: 2250MB The limit seems to be the system RAM. I loaded 213 maps, more than 6GB and still okay and responsive. The plugin has a builtin database (WeatherFaxSchedules.xml) for HF Radio Weather Service Fax transmissions, which when used properly can automatically alert the user and begin decoding these faxes. This schedule is updated from time to time using schedules and frequencies of all the official fax services worldwide from https://www.weather.gov/media/marine/rfax.pdf The detailed DWD schedule is also useful https://www.dwd.de/EN/specialusers/shipping/broadcast_en/broadcast_fax_102020.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=1 Retrieve > RF Radio Schedule Menu on the Filter Tab. Retrieve > RF Radio Schedule Menu on the 1 minute Alarm Tab. Retrieve > RF Radio Schedule Menu on the Capture Options Tab. Retrieve > RF Radio Schedule Menu on the Information Tab. Select Retrieve → Audio Capture (Ctrl+A) A line from the SSB radio to the audio input of the sound card should be attached, and the radio tuned to the appropriate frequency (1.9khz below listed frequency and SSB mode) The SSB BFO must be adjusted correctly. The images decoded can then be calibrated and overlayed on charts. The resulting image can be exported to a chart, so the plugin also works as a general purpose conversion tool to make charts from images. The plugin can read and open numerous common image files, and audio files, and can save Kap files. The next step in development is to have it read Kap for ease of use with respect to coordinates being recorded and reused.

(I called the directory FaxWx). Open the Plugin and a fax file and use the Weatherfax Image Wizard From OpenCPN select the Weatherfax Icon, a window pops up. Select Open and browse to the FaxWx directory and select a fax file. Open the file. The objective is to set the x/y coordinates and lat/long properly so that the image will map directly over the proper area on the charts/globe. The Image Wizard allows user control over the necessary settings in a step by step process which ends in a successful chart overlay or not, depending on the skill of the user. If it does not work properly the first time, simply try it again. There are two basic types of projections the wizard can handle. If the fax is a Mercator projection (orthogonal, not polar), click through the next screen that comes up and at the second screen set the coordinates and lat/long properly. (Screenshots will be added later) and click on through to see the fax overlaid on the charts. Note: It is very difficult to test for poor coordinate and lat/long input, so it is best to have your lat long correct, otherwise strange things may happen with the overlay in Opencpn. I first use a separate image viewer with the selected fax image, to zoom in and to write down the Lat/long and coordinates that I will be using. If you plan to export to a chart file then you should select “Get Aspect Ratio” There are other techniques used to modify a Polar fax onto a Mercator projection chart which are reviewed on the forum and will be more fully described later. Review the posts following this Cruiser’s Forum Post in the Weatherfax Thread in the Forums. Coordinate 1 (Red) -Select a high latitude which must also lie on the vertical meridian running through the pole (N or S) Coordinate 2 (Blue) - Select an opposing corner (either side) with lower latitude. Then hit Get Map, the Blue circles should follow the latitudes of respective coords. Adjust the left/right location with the PoleX value and adjust the circle radius with the PoleY value. Set the True Width Ratio value to 1.0. From here, it should be possible to click “get mapping” True width Ratio - Adjusts the width of the blue circles (a fraction like .8 makes the circles wider, and 1.2 makes them narrower). Adjust the true width ratio such that the blue circles align with the associated latitude lines, otherwise the “Apply” transformation will not render straight lat/long lines or will fail. Pole X - Moves the center of the blue circles left and right. The blue circles should be centered on the vertical meridian which goes through the pole. Pole Y - Moves the center of the blue circles up and down. The blue circles should be centered on the pole. Hit get mapping to see how this is working, because the blue rings change in width, and sometime the ring closest to the pole flips if the value is too far out of whack. Equator Y - This does not appear to do much when you change the value, more about this value later. If you are starting fresh with a Polar, and the blue rings are too wide after hitting Get Mapping, first check the lat/long entered and reset coords to be sure they are hit, then Hit 'get mapping again' then adjust the “True width ratio” so the blue rings align with the latitude lines. Once that is done don’t hit “Get Mapping” again, hit “Apply” the lines should be straight and orthogonal. Here is an example of a WxFax overlay in Opencpn Image files that are downloaded and overlaid onto charts with specific coordinates, can now be saved as Kap files that save long/lat and coordinates with the file. Hopefully the plugin will also be made to read Kap files so that they can be automatically overlaid on charts without having to use the WeatherFax Image Wizard. It is the User’s job to update this information, by sending newly updated files of their area of the world. We cannot devote programming resources to this location specific task which changes regularly. Note that the file weatherfaxinternetretrieval.xml has been separated into world region xml files, to make this task easier. We need voluteers to take a region and send in updates every six months to a year. Github pull requests to the maintainer for these changes are easiest, but emailed files are accepted too. The critical files are: . WeatherfaxInternetRetrieval_(Region).xml’s (Multiple Regional files) . CoordinateSets.xml (installed in the program directory and saved in the User writable directory) . WeatherfaxSchedule.xml - For capture of sound. To start out with a clean slate, no previous weatherfax xml files. Remove the %localappdata%/opencpn/plugins/weatherfax/data files Use Options > Plugins > Uninstall the plugin. Remove the local user directory data, in particular coordinateSets.xml Manually remove this directory \"C:\\ProgramData\\opencpn\\plugins\\weatherfax\" or empty it. Not necessary, but you can manually remove all weatherfax_pi tarballs from \"C:\\ProgramData\\opencpn\\plugins\\cache\\tarballs\". For more information about the location of installation files see the Development Manual - Installation Paths https://opencpn-manuals.github.io/main/plugin-installer/Installation-paths.html Use search \"CoordinateSets.xml\" in your files to determine where the Opencpn local user (writable) files are stored if you don’t know already. When weatherfax_pi tarballs are installed, updated %localappdata%/opencpn/plugins/weatherfax/data files are installed. After internet weatherfax files are retrieved using Retrieve > Update Data Files and when weatherfax or opencpn is closed, the coordinateSets.xml in memory is saved to the User writable directory C:\\ProgramData\\opencpn\\plugins\\weatherfax with any Image Wizard coordinate changes made by the User. If the original coordinate name is use the changes are save to the new CoordinateSets.xml file ( instead of the installation coordinateSets.xml file at %localappdata%/opencpn/plugins/weatherfax/data). If New Coordinates is selected from the dropdown menu in the upper left (or New Coordinates 2 or 3) then those are saveed in a new User_CoordinateSets.xml file also located in the user writable directory C:\\ProgramData\\opencpn\\plugins\\weatherfax and which is used for the image in future downloads. We also notice that the empty WeatherfaxInternetRetrieval.xml file and WeatherfaxSchedule.xml are copied to this directory as well. Is this so that users can customize them? I am not sure what is happening here. Should all the WeatherfaxInternetRetrieval_(Regional).xml files be copied there? Which files are actually being used by the program? The weatherfaxinternetretrieval.xml and weatherfaxschedules.xml files must be maintained and updated by all the USERS! Contribute your special url’s and schedules for the benefit of all. WeatherfaxInternetRetrieval.xml is dependent on many MET website services worldwide, and users who contribute xml files. WeatherfaxSchedules.xml is created from NOAA’s current Worldwide RF Radio Schedule https://www.weather.gov/nwr&in_desc=NOAA+Weather+Radio/ and https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/radiofax.shtml Users are asked to submit error reports and updated xml files through github.com/rgleason/weatherfax_pi using \"Issues\" and attaching files or make a pull request.

By merging the results of many calculations, it is possible to form a map determining routes to any given location within the map. First, load the grib file used for routing using the grib plugin. Next, open the Weather Routing plugin from the main toolbar and right click the map and Select \"Weather Route Position\" at the starting location. Repeat this step for the destination. Now, in the Weather Routing window from the Configuration menu (next to File) Select \"New\". From here you must configure your vessel correctly in the boat dialog; add a polar to specify how the boat sails. When ready, select \"Compute\" from the Configuration menu to compute the weather route. Integration with the grib plugin allows for knowledge of weather conditions. The climatology plugin can also provide a source of data for longer voyages, but be warned that using the climatology data, especially in variable wind areas is unlikely to give realistic results. Using climatology for currents is more useful and can be used with grib wind data when grib current data is not available. For example, in the case where data is valid from both sources, grib will always be choosen. If current data is available from climatology, and only wind from grib, then the grib wind is used with the climatology current. The grib time selected on the timeline at the time the computation is started can be syncronized. From there, the grib timeline data is accessed as the computation proceeds. Once a computation is completed, the course and position of the boat as it sails along the computed route can be viewed during grib playback. Wind data is required; if no Current or Swell data is available, they are assumed to be zero.

Boat Performance Data: Polar Files The quest for perfect polars. There are many factors involved and various sources. Polar_pi Create Polar files from recorded nmea0183 or vdr data. VDR_pi Record the OpenCPN nmea0183 data stream. Your boat’s Boat Performance Data - Polar Data or Outside Polar File Sources. Accuracy may vary significantly in different conditions. Three sources for Polar Files: Polar sample files: (700) provided from within the plugin. Accuracy for your boat may vary dependent on loading of stores, sails, sail trim, bottom condition and sea state. Many of these polars, some developed by the Builder’s Marine Architect using VPP assuming ideal conditions, are overly optimistic! WP has a simple solution, adjust the Wind Strength percent under the Configuration Advanced Tab until you get some good recordings to use. Actual performance: measured in specific sea conditions recorded by VDR_pi and converted by Polar_pi. The best recordings are with Zero current, noting sea state and sails set and trim.

Help > Information Configuration Defaults Irma Hurricane Example Polar File Conversion Luckygrib has superb introductory documentation for WeatherRouting. This started out as an excellent grib viewer/download for ipad and imac only. This documentation is worth reviewing first for general principals. Trip or voyage planning. Establishing good weather windows for trip starts. Calculation of multiple routes at the same time. Highlight and step through multiple “completed' routes at the same time. Study for best routes dependent on goals and constraints set. Adjust Wind Speed as a percentage, which helps to set realistic goals. Include multiple polars in your Boat file for different conditions and sail sets. Include a motoring polar in your Boat file particularly for light winds. Power Boat use for trip start time, fuel reduction, comfort routing and ETA. Route around predicted high winds (hurricanes), light winds, large waves, etc. Show possible sail changes and % crossover. Compare routes with Grib file currents enabled and disabled. Attach two downloaded grib files (weather and current) with similar location and time. Summary metro table of the voyage for good weather visual. Views and Reports View settings. Number of tacks, % upwind/downwind, etc. to determine how difficult the voyage will be. Trip Summaries: Estimated total time, distance, average speed etc. to help determine the stores needed. Planning airline tickets (but only as a very very rough estimate). Remember that it is only as good as the accuracy of your polars and predictive and average data! Weather Routing: Calculation of the fastest/safest route from a starting point to an ending point given the current national weather forecasts, available wind data, current oceanic currents , the performance of your vessel, and comfort criteria (storms, wind, waves, etc.) Altendorff Routing Algorithms - More about Optimum Weather Route Figure 1. Weather Routing using Grib and Climatology Data When the weather route is displayed, Grib and Climatology calculations use different color schemes as in the route above. * Grib = Blue-Green-Purple. * Climatology = Red-Pink-Yellow where the Grib data does not exist. Isochrones While calculating a Weather Routing the plugin will calculate the location of the boat for a given time interval (eg: 1 hr, 4hr, 6 hr or 12hr ) and display an isochrone contour line which represents how far the boat will sail in a given direction, based on the weather and boat conditions, for each successive time interval. Isochrones are like contour lines around the starting point. Think of Isochrones as showing an intermediate destination time lines with different distances from the start point. Left Pink-Yellow Isochrones: Beginning passage uses Climatology data because the boat is outside the Grib area. Middle Blue-Cyan Isochrones: Computation is based on Grib data. Right Pink-Yellow Isochrones: End of passage, Grib data not available so again Climatology data is used. If the transition from grib to climatology is not uniform, then the climatology data is not as reliable in that situation. Figure 2.

Help > Information Menu (Configuration) Menus and Definitions Terminology Reference used in this Manual. Configuration and Computation of a optimal routing is at the center of the plugin. Configuration Defaults are reset after hitting Reset all Advanced. Configuration Five default configurations using Climatology_pi. Initial Default Examples ready to Compute and Complete. Compute After configuration of the routing, select Compute. The routing will Complete or Fail with a message Weather Routing is a \"very capable\" plugin which can use six other plugins concurrently, so stick to basics when starting out. Grib Step Through Time Interval Step through the Grib file changing time interval, frame by frame, hour by hour, to understand the Routing. Grib Time Routing Start time must be inside the particular grib file’s time period. If the routing takes longer than the grib, the routing will fail:grib unless Climatology_pi is enabled and set in Weather_routing. Start time can be set quickly in WR Menu Configuration > Basic Tab > Grib Time button As you learn more, you can refine start and end times. Data at Cursor: Run your cursor along the route with the Grib_pi Menu and “Wind speed at Cursor” on. It is very useful for diagnostics along a problematic route. Grib Weather Table: When a grib shows on the screen, right click and pick Weather Table (see screenshot below) WeatherRouting additional information After computation of a routing, highlight the Configuration, pick View in the menu at the top then select Settings, Statistics, Report, Plot or Cursor for more information. (see screenshot below0 WeatherRouting View settings Pick View > Settings. Help > Information Menu (Configuration) Access this page from the Help > Information Menu. Review while stepping through the plugin menus, looking particularly at Edit Boat.xml and Edit Polar File (.csv, .txt, .pol) Try to understand the menu system. Boat.xml simply contains a list of boat polar files to use in the routing. The polar files can be edited, saved and saved as. Use the Grib Plugin and recently downloaded grib files for completing grib predictive routing (1-8 days). Use the Climatology Plugin to find and plan long term cruising routes, (most useful in prevailing winds areas). Use both Grib and Climatology data, to allow the routing to be extended past the time/date range of the grib file, which uses Climatology data to extend the Routing based on NOAA “average” or “most likely” data. Use both Grib and Climatology to use “tidal current data” if the grib does not contain it, or to use climatology to avoid areas ofcyclones. Your first goal should be to read this manual several times while trying to understand the menus and structure. Then to make a routing yourself. The “Configuration” and “Computation” of an optimal weather routing is at the heart of this plugin. Weather_routing is remarkably flexible, but with that comes complexity. New users must not dive in changing settings without understanding what they are doing or how it affects the Computation. Generally the Configuration Default settings are the most reliable available. After hitting Reset all Advanced most of the advanced configuration settings can be left alone. However there are definitely some Configuration settings the user must set manually in order to get any results! The first goal is to Complete your first routing successfully. Please follow this tutorial carefully and you will succeed the first time. Once you get familiar with the interface and have had successes, learn all the features gradually, changing and adjusting one setting at a time. Use Reset Advanced Tab to go back the working defaults when you run into trouble, or install the example files again for a fresh start. Before starting, backup your own personal user data from this plugin. In particular your Boat.xml file and your boat’s unique polar files, and any WR routings you wish to keep. Generally we recommend that the plugin and configuration artifacts should be completely removed before installation of the new version, in order to allow the intended initialization files to be copied from the System folder to a User Writable folder. The plugin expects a clean environment before initializing and copying the appropriate files into the user directories. You must “Clean” your opencpn files of all weather_routing files and folders or the initialization that is required will not occur. For windows users, from: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\OpenCPN 4.8.0 —> Run Uninstall Weather_routing.exe as administrator. C:\\ProgramData\\opencpn —> Open opencpn.ini in Notepad++ and remove all lines for weather_routing and weatherrouting, including the order of plugins “weatherrouting” reference. C:\\ProgramData\\opencpn\\plugins —> Remove the Weather_routing directory. Grib_pi is installed with OpenCPN. Learn how to use it and download a fresh Grib file with wind, current & waves. Initially the grib area should be larger than the area between start and finish by at least two time intervals, The number of days Should be for several more days than expected and dependent on how long the voyage is expected. Set the grib at the starting time and then move it one or two time intervals forward, later with more experience you may set the Grib data and time at what you want. Request and install a new grib file and learn how this plugin works. Figure 3. Grib Display Control Climatology_pi must be installed and enabled as directed for default examples to work. Climatology_pi is Enabled under Opencpn Options > Plugins. Weather_Routing in the Menu Configuration > New or Edit > Data Source > Climatology select from the Dropdown Menu Most Likely which we use almost exclusively. Weather_Routing will then access Climatology Data. Adjust Climatology settings for the wind roses and learn how this plugin works. Figure 4. Wind Roses are too small Climatology NOAA 30 year average Wind and Current data in September near Cape Lookout Figure 5. Set Size to 100 and Spacing to 50 + Climatology Configuration of Wind Roses Size=100 and Spacing=50 is good. If you are working with Land Interferance Detect Land you must install GSHHS. Use Chart downloader to download and install a GSHHS High Resolution Background for routing with Detect Land checked. Select the GSHHS Catalog and update the catalog. Then download the GSHHS to the default location. We also suggest that under Options > Charts Tab > Chart Files that you add the path to the GSHHS files. Then in the Chart Group Tab make a new Chart Group named GSHHS and add the path to them. Then you will be able to select the GSHHS Chart Group with no charts to save memory and speed up your computer. Install and Enable Plugins and the weather_routing plugin from within OpenCPN using Options > Plugins That’s it. But before you can actually use Weather_Routing_pi, you first have to Confirm that the Weather_Routing Plugin has been installed and enabled. Enable Grib_pi plugin which is included with OpenCPN. Confirm Climatology_pi plugin has been installed and enabled (required by Default Example files). Confirn that Climatology has been set to Most Likely in Weather_routing Configuration. Confirm that GSHHS High resolution files have been installed. Note: Legacy PI Package installation files are still available from Download Page -Linux, Windows, Mac. Make sure you choose the file that is compatible with your computer system. Activate OpenGL in order to have the route display on top of the grib layer! Options > Dispay > Advanced > Check Use Accelerated Graphics This is the typical configuration for Windows (Linux uses comparable User accessible directories): Main Path for support files: C:\\ProgramData\\opencpn\\plugins\\weather_routing WeatherRoutingConfiguration.xml: C:\\ProgramData\\opencpn\\plugins\\weather_routing Polar Files (.pol,.txt,.csv): C:\\ProgramData\\opencpn\\plugins\\weather_routing\\polars Boat.Xml Files: C:\\ProgramData\\opencpn\\plugins\\weather_routing\\boat Start Climatology_pi, although it will start automatically if called. Start Grib_pi (normally used, but not necessary with the default “Configurations” which use Climatology. Set the Grib Date has been already set in the default configurations. Then open Weather_routing_pi. Confirm the “Boat section” path is correct as shown above in the Pathname list. Confirm the “Polar” path is correct as shown above in the Pathname list. In the menu you should find 5 configurations for transatlantic routes. Pick a route and then select “Compute from the bottom of the menu. Check that the isobars and route is drawn. Try Computing the other routes, noticing how the settings have been changed, and what files are being used. Once you are pretty confident about this, go to the next step, which is to create your own configurations. The plugin is packaged with 4 configurations using Climatology Wind Data that should Compute out of the box. The 4 Weather Routing Configurations in the Weather-Routing-Configuration with require installation and Enabling Climatology_pi and selecting Climatology dropdown menu Most Likely in the WR Configuration. To run one of the initally installed examples simply highlight one of the routing Configurations in the main menu and then select Compute. After learning through use of the Examples, you should Configure weather_routing to match your sound judgment and realistic goals. You are in control, use your own judgement when you review the results. Weather_Routing_pi is just a tool in your hands, you are in control. Figure 6. WeatherRoutingConfiguration.xml Positions If the plugin is installed and enabled, with default settings unchanged or Reset all Advanced is used, the plugin should create an optimized weather routing with just a few specific additional settings and Computation. Complete Setup Grib_pi Data and Setup Climatology_pi Data as described above. Start by clicking on the Toolbar Weather_routing plugin Icon to open the Weather_routing_Configuration Menu. WR WeatherRoutingConfiguration.xml Menu NOTE: You are now diverging from the Example files, and learning how to configure a new route using Climatology Data. Define two Weather Route Positions on the chart within the “grib area”. Hover the mouse at a selected location, Right Click, and then pick “Weather Route Position” from the popup menu. Make a “Boston” and a “Halifax” Weather Route Position. Figure 7. WR New Postion image::ccc-castine-grib.png[title=\"Grib Display Control\",width=500, In the WR WeatherRoutingConfiguration.xml menu select ConfigurationNew. The Weather Routing Configuration Menu will appear with “Start”=Boston and “End”=Halifax. Figure 8. WR New Configuration Scan the setting to check that they are as shown in the image. Check Start and End selections. If not correct, select these WP Positions from the respective dropdowns. Figure 9. WR Configuration Menu Set Start Date & Time. If you have set start date & time in Grib_pi as described above. NOTE: You can download appropriate grib data and load it into grib_pi for this exercise, or you can just use Climatology data, it won’t make a difference. From the Weather Routing Configuration Menu click Grib Time to set the Start Date/Time used by the “Configuration” for the routing. The Grib Time used will be the current frame used and visible in Grib_pi. There are other ways to do this, but use this way to start. Weather_routing_pi uses [Boat].xml files to store multiple [Polar].pol, *.csv or *.txt filenames which are used with the Current ”Configuration”. Also the [Boat].xml file can be “Save as Boat” to another boat filename such as Boat-Test.xml or [Your-Boat-Medium-Wind-Heavy-Sea-Clean-Bottom].xml. Figure 10. WR Configuration Boat.xml Many new users have have trouble “Completing” Weather Route Configurations due to Polar:Fail messages, which is often because the single polar they have used only has TWS from 6-20 knots and does not span the entire true wind speed range of the particular grib file being used. This files below are an earlier example and are still useful at times. However the plugin now comes configured with a new set of Example files all ready built_in. It it best to use those examples unless you want to start out fresh. The file names are similar but the details are a little different. We will try to update the files below to match the one in the distribution, ..at some point. To help new users when starting out, we have created a Boat-test.xml file that references three “polar-xx-xxx-x-xx.pol” files which cover a full TWS (True Wind Speed) range of 0-60 knots. The Weather_routing Configuration will utilize the best polar information from the multiple polar files in Boat-test.xml after computing the “Sail/Polar Crossover” calculations between the different polar files being used. Three Boat.xml zipped files unzip to C:\\ProgramData\\opencpn\\plugins\\weather_routing\\boat which are preconfigured files that should work with the Polar and WeatherRoutingConfiguration.XML file downloads. These files are the same as 4. Setup Weather Routing* above. Boat.XML Boat-test.XML Boat-Test-Power.XML Later on, after some successful weather routings, users are encouraged to create separate boat performance [polar].pol files for: Sets of Sails Used (Sail Changes, First & Second Reefs) Sea conditions (Waves - Rough, Chop, Height, Period) Boat load (Race Light, Cruising, Heavy) Boat bottom condition (Smooth, Grass, Barnacles, Loaded) Example of useful Polars LW-light wind (0-5 knots) Sail set #1 MW-medium wind (5-18 knots) Sail set #2 HW-heavy wind (18-24 knots) Sail set #3 SW-storm wind (24-32 knots) Sail set #4 GW-gail wind (32-60 knots) Hove to, Drogue. LW-lightwind-Power (0-3 knots) Polluting Internal Combustion Engine Using the sails normally used for each type of wind, such that the full range of True Wind Speed (TWS) is represented (0-60 knots). These files can be inspected and edited with a text editor such as Notepad++ or they can more easily be edited using the Polar section Edit Menu and the two Tabs Grid and Dimensions. Learn how they are formatted (particularly *.pol) as this will assist you in creating useful polars for your boat. Polar Files for Learning (User Friendly) Polars-Pol.zip Please Download, unzip and copy the six *.pol files listed below into your data\\polars directory. For Windows use: C:\\ProgramData\\opencpn\\plugins\\weather_routing\\data\\polars These files are the same as 4. Setup Weather Routing above.

If you just want to use one file for TWS 0-60 knots use Test-TWS-0-20+60.pol. Once the three files have been added, next pick Save as Boat then type Boat-Test and “Save” to create and save “Boat-Test.xml” Now when Computing “new” Configurations first check the configuration by selecting Boat-Test.xml at the Boat section “….” just ahead of “Edit” in the “Configuration” Menu. Once that completes properly, then create a “Boat.xml” file for your boat with reference to your normal boat polars and use that. Shows the highlighted polar file graphically as a familiar polar diagram. Note that the dropdown menus at the bottom provide different useful ways of viewing the boat performance data. Figure 15.

In the WR WeatherRoutingConfiguration.xml menu, highlight the Configuration you’ve created and select Compute. Now new isochrones will be created and a weather routing from Boston to Halifax will be “completed”. Figure 18. WR Compute In the Configuration Menu after “Compute”, a message will show to the right of the Configuration. “Complete” affirms that the computations completed. “Fail” indicates they did not and that some setup parameter may be out of range. The failure messages have been made to be more descriptive to help. If your polar doesn’t include boat speeds: Above a windspeed that the grib tries to use, it will fail to route. Below a windspeed that the grib tries to use, it will fail to route. There are many reasons a Computation cannot complete, or fail. The computation is dependent on: Wind Data (grib_pi or climatology_pi) - Start & End data/time of the file, interval downloaded. Boat Polar File - Correct format, with a wind range that matches the grib data. Time Interval Issues - Sometimes 1/2 -1 hr interval will yield a better route than 3-4 hr and it may help “Complete”. Max Diverted Route - Normal setting is 100 degrees, which speeds up calculations, but with longer time intervals, you may have to set this on something like 140-160 degrees to complete the routing, particularly when the Finish is near land with Islands and Peninsulas around. Configuration settings which must be made to be compatible with the data to Complete: Interval Issues - Too long a calculation interval for the distance between start and end. Land Detail - Detect land is checked and the High Resolution GSHHS Shoreline is not installed. Land Interface Failure - Routing near land is complex, zoom in and look at the Isobars. Sometimes they are not calculated for all locations due to the complexity of the land (not enough detail or iterations). Try new Weather Routing Position nearby where there are isobars shown, or shorten the time interval or max diverted course. Max Diverted Course - When “Polar:Fail” or “Polar:No Data” occurs near the “finish” using large Time Intervals (4hr - 24hr). Zoom in and look at the route, isochrones, finish, and land. If the route is almost completed to “Finish” (with land, islands and peninsulas around) try changing Max Diverted Course from 100 degrees to 150 degrees and run it again. It will probably complete. Different Time Intervals - Keeping everything else the same. Beginners should first try a simple route, with starting point and end point, 5 degree steps, and possibly a 3 hour time interval until they see it is working. The time interval depends on the speed of the boat and distance traveled, grib file downloaded. If the Configuration was completing Computation earlier and you changed a setting, check that first. If a Configuration fails, another thing to try is Reset All, and go through the setup sequence above, again. If “Polar:Failed” try increasing or reducing the Weather Routing ConfigurationWind Strength % (50%, 150%) because the Polar File may not have the required winds specified. The grib file may have periods of very high winds or very low winds which are not covered by the polar diagram wind range. Then try using different data, either change the grib start date, moving it forward, or try using only Climatology Data, or change the Polar File to something else, or add multiple polar files, just to get the Configuration working. Provides setup flexibility for various factors: Start location, date and time. End location. Step duration for isochrones in hours and minutes (12 hours for long routes, 1 hour for shorter) For Time Step I generally start larger and once things are working, go smaller, the distance governs what the tme step is. Divide the time expected to sail the course into 10 and use that number for the Time Step. Then adjust as needed. Degree Steps (5 is faster than 1). Generally leave Courses (relative to true wind) alone, From 0 to 180 by 5 degrees is fine. Boat Performance based on editing boat specifications or based on a polar data file. Set constraints on various factors such as max wind, swell, waves, latitude, max diverted course etc… Start Grib_pi and/or Climatology_pi Set Grib_pi to the date and time you want to use. Then go to the Weather_routing Config menu and pick “Grib Time” Set options like detect land, currents, inverted regiions, anchoring. Routes can be Edited (created, selected, renamed, reset and exported.) Figure 19. WD Boat Edit Configuration and Edit Boat.xml,title=\"WR Configuration and Edit Boat.xml\",width=600]] Settings To eliminate the black lines of all Alternate Routes, in Settings you can set the alternate route thickness to zero. Statistics Report Plot Cursor Position First job See 2. Setup Climatology as many of the samples included with Weather_Routing use Climatology. Don’t forget to Enable Climatology and under WR Configuration pick \"Most Likely\" for Climatology. Boat position (round circle) is when stepping through the grib file (assuming you use a grib file and not climatology of course). Figure 20. WR Grib Time Control Moreover, if multiple routes are computed and shown (selected), when stepping through the grib the boat position is shown simultaneously on each route. When you step through the grib you will see the boat position at that current grib time (not “the multipier of the two time intervals”). This can be right on an isochrone or between two isochrones (if grib interval is smaller than wxrte time interval). Weather Routing will use two grib files that are loaded by Grib_pi. This is useful when you have downloaded a GFS Wind and Pressure Grib, and an RTOFS Current Grib of similar time period and resolution. First Load two Grib Files Concurrently (Wind and Current) in Grib_pi. Then in WR Configuration check the Currents box. Figure 21. WR Two Grib Weather and Current + In this Baltic Sea example there is an underlying current file with black arrows and the area of the grib is shown in light read. The wind pressure grib is shown with brown arrows with feathers. The Route Manager can be used for listing the weather route. Right click a weather route and pick “Properties”. Also a Weather Routing can be Exported to a gpx file or saved to a Route in Route Manager. Create Boundaries recognized by Weather_Routing_pi. Boundary avoidance is useful for guiding the routing. Create a boundary in Ocpn_Draw, make sure it is visible and then in WR check \"Detect Boundary\" under Configuration Options Figure 22. WR Ockam Polar Grib 4 day with boundary Red hatched Boundary along the Nova Scotia coast was created in Ocpn_Draw and used in weather_routing, to prevent routing in that area. Figure 23.

Sample files showing how time interval and max diverted course adjustments may help completion Review the Irma Hurricane Examples page and download and install the example files. The plugin requires Boat performance data (polar data). The more accurate it is for the condition of the boat and seastate, the more accurate the routings will be. There are many Polar Data files included but Polar Data can be developed from: Boat Instrument data created while sailing in current-free conditions. See Polar_pi using OpenCPN Nmea0183 data directly or recorded VDR_pi file. VDR_pi recording of nmea0183 data stream, converted to a Polar file by Polar_pi. Voyage Recordings to create polars: Use Opencpn VDR_pi RPI3 or Yacht Devices Voyage Recorder Polauto (Windows) VPP Velocity Prediction Programs using the boat’s physical measurements. Polar Data files are available in the Weather_routing Plugin. You select a starter polar file for your boat from within the plugin. Yacht Devices using Excel: Case: How to plot a polar diagram for a yacht using data collected by Voyage Recorder Note: Boat performance data should be in a format compatible with weather_routing_pi. The plugin will convert the file to a format that can be used (fixing certain minor variations and irregularities) or declare it unusable. The companion plugin Polar_pi also produces compatible polar files. Boat Performance Information Notes. The plugin may have a section with some rough VPP calcs which is not fully functional at this time. The manual does not cover use of these experimental sections. You are welcome to try them out. Note: Gribs are dated predictive data, and will be subject to change over time due to the dynamic nature of weather. Generally data past 2-3 days is unreliable, and the longest grib available is 16 days (with larger time intervals between data points). For longer voyages, climatology_p provides a very useful 30 year average grib dataset. Weather_Routing_pi has a full set of polar files, but there are other sources: Seapilot PolarFiles PolarFile Collection (cloud) qtvlm polars ORC Polars L_36 Polar_Polars Distant Shores on Polar Performance Good advice, adjust VPP Polars for Cruising Boat Performance Data - Polar Data. Record in consistent conditions for various conditions, see why. Ockham:What are Polars? Ockham: Make your own? Yachting World: Polars 5 tips Sometimes a good polar is available for appropriate conditions, but it just needs to be converted for use in OpenCPN. Often this is automatically handled by Polar_pi or Weather_routing, but sometimes manual editing is necessary. Polar File Conversion Examples Frequently Asked Questions is intended to answer questions that might arise. Message \"Polar:Fail\"? It is very frustrating. See: CF Thread Polar Fail Add other polars to the boat file to cover those wind speeds. Increase/Decrease the Interval, try 1-8 hr sometimes an alternate optimal route will appear. Reduce Wind to 50% or 25%. Increase Wind to 110% or 125%. Use Boat.XML or Boat-Test.xml with TWS 0-60 knots.(original file, unchanged) Use a different set of Polars. Find the high or low wind area and times, then change the route accordingly. Try a different grib file from another time with in the same area. Zoom into where it fails and look. Near land can cause problems. Try making a slightly new Destination point if it fails just short. Undo the most recent changes you have made, if you had it working recently. When this happens go back to basics, Reset to Configuration Default settings. See the CF Post about this and refer to the default list in this manual above. Or download the 4. Setup Weather Routing above, install it again and start over. with climatology only, seem to be missing voyage data, such as duration, time of start and finish If we are using a specific date and time for the start, why is this happening? It is most likely that the routing did not reach the destination. -Understand that the routing ends if destination is inside two isochrones, which is likely what you have, but remember between these two isochrones the boat can only move in straight lines and if there’s land in the way, the destination could be unreachable. Islands and Harbors are very prone to this kind of issue. Try a new destination (or start) well outside of the harbor. This issue occurs at both the start and the finish when the routing is tends to be near land with islands, harbors and complex shorelines, or try shortening the interval. Why doesn’t synchronize position on route, display with grib display? Try uninstalling the weather_routing plugin and removing all files and configuration from the system as outlined in the manual then re-install and make a new configuration. Now you should see a red circle moving along the route as you step thru the Grib file. Edit Boat > Plot Tab What is the difference These are the optimum upwind and downwind lines for best velocity made good. The colors show up best with the left dropdown set on “Speed” rather than “Plot” Figure 24. Edit Boat.xml Plot Tab Boat Speed is shown as SOG and SOW when they are different. If they are the same, only one value is shown. When you step through the grib you will see the boat position at that current grib time. This can be right on an isochrone or between two isochrones (if grib interval is smaller than wxrte time interval). Grib data Time Interval: Available in 3,6 and 12 hour intervals. Weather_Routing Time Interval: Often set to a smaller interval, say 3 or 1 hour intervals. But sometimes to complete to the destination the interval has to be set considerably smaller, say 10 minutes. Weather_routing will then interpolate the Grib file interval down to 10 minutes. When you try to step through the grib file to understand the conditions on the routing, you will jump across the interpolated isochrones. This is determined by the weatherrouting time interval. For example: From the WeatherRoutingConfiguration results the arrival time is 21:33, for a departure at 12:00. This means a duration of 9 hours, or three grib intervals of 3 hours. Consistent with the 3 steps in grib controller (3 hour time intervals). If you have weather_routing time interval set to 10 minutes, the boat will skip over 18 isochrones for each step of the grib controller. View > Settings “Alternates for all isochrones” is unchecked and there are still black alternate routes showing. How do I eliminate them? Set alternate route thickness to “0” on the View > Settings menu. Create a new position with the same name to replace it. There is then a prompt to overwrite the old location. This works from the context menu on the chart also. Voyage Recordings to create polars: Use Opencpn VDR_pi RPI3 or Yacht Devices Voyage Recorder Yacht Devices using Excel: Case: How to plot a polar diagram for a yacht using data collected by Voyage Recorder Data Weather_routing is only as good as the data provided by the Grib plugin and the Climatology plugin. Grib plugin: Depends on recent download grib files from Noaa and other sources. Downloaded Grib predicitions can change significantly over several days. The longer the grib prediction is, the less reliable the grib can be. Climatology plugin: Can be used for analyzing long cruising routes through various seasons and constraints, but does not take into account the current weather conditions which often vary significantly from the 30 year average, especially outside of prevailing wind areas. These planning tools may be helpful, but should be taken with a healthy “grain of salt” as any good sailor (who looks out to the horizon) should know. Weather Routes The weather routes created may not consider or “see” normal navigation considerations and issues, therefore every route should be checked very carefully for navigation markers, shallow depths, bad currents, rocks, land and other obstacles and hazards. Configuration of Installation files Stelian wrote: In fact, the paths in WeatherRoutingConfig.xml and the boat XML files need to be there, because they tell the plugin where to find the corresponding boat/polar files. And since there might be several boat or polar names with the same name (but located in different folders), the paths need to tell which one is to be used. However, there is one exception to this: at the packaging time, we don’t know where the files will be installed - we know we want to put these in the user directory (ProgramData), but this path is dynamic, it depends on the user name (in case of multiuser systems). For example, on Linux, it might be /home/stelian/.opencpn/plugins/… or /home/rick! So what we’ve done is to change the code to allow the config file to use name without the path. The plugin, when it tries to open the file and if there is no path before, will automatically append the user directory path. This is why the xml files containing the default configuration need to have only the filenames and not the paths inside. Moreover, the files can contain the path to the contours. This path, once again, is dependent on the user. So we’ve just removed the CrossOverContours from the boat xml files, and made sure that the plugin will regenerate the contours upon start. For the date problems, well, we simply noticed in the XML file that the dates were in mm/dd/yy format, so I’ve just modified them to yyyy-mm-dd, (if you had saved the files using the current version of the plugin this should have been done automatically). There was an hour issue too, the file had 09:00 (local time I suppose), I put 00:00:00 instead, I don’t think it matters much anyway for such long routes. I also renamed a boat.XML file to .xml (notice case), it’s more standard that way (I know that windows doesn’t care much, but on the other systems the conventions are quite strong). Notes New dialog to display which sail plan is at the cursor in View→Cursor Position. Alternately it might be interesting to have a display option to color the route map the same as the cross-over chart. There is a box on the route to show each sail change.

Notice what files are being used. Once you are pretty confident about this, go to the next step. Which is to create your own configurations. These are 5 Weather Routings in \"Weather-Routing-Setup\" that should Complete when using the small grib file for hurricane Irma. Weather_routing would not normally be used for this weather, as it is time to haul, however in emergency situations it could be used to develop avoidance measures by setting conservative maximum wind speeds in your configuration. These routings below do find circuitous avoidance routes based upon their Configuration values, but the values could be made even more conservative. The purpose of these examples is to illustrate the dependence of Completed routings on a number of values and constraints. When a routing Fails, the user needs to learn and understand what values need to be adjusted. Adjustment of Time Interval is just one of the settings to be considered in Weather Route Configuration. Figure 1. First Routing Default Settings - 4 hr Interval Figure 2. Second routing- 5hr Interval Figure 3. Third Routing Default Settings - 2 hr Interval Figure 4. Fourth Routing Default Settings - 3 hr Interval Figure 5. Fifth routing- 4hr Interval Computation of Routes from Cape Canaveral with different Intervals These routes are also in “Weather-Routing-Setup Zip Files” and illustrate how different Time Intervals may interact with Land causing Failures depending on the configuration of the Finish point with land masses. Notice that Cape Canaveral 4 & 5 (4 & 5 hour Time Intervals) both Failed. Changing to a smaller Time Interval is a reasonable response to help Complete and so is changing the Default Max Diverted Course from 100 to 150 degrees, both of which require more computation. The other alternative is to use a different Weather Routing Position for the Finish, which is further away from the interfering land masses. Note that the optimum weather route that is computed changes with the Time Interval due to interaction with Land mass at the edges of the Wind data. Choosing Finish points that are clear from Land Masses, Smaller Time Intervals and greater Max Diverted Course will generally help in these cases. The very different routes taken with each time interval all result in Trip times of 5days-1/2hr to 5days-4-1/2hrs which are quite small differences given the divergent routes. In planning your trips you may want to take advantage of these alternatives which are shown with use of different Time Intervals, depending on your goals. Figure 6.

Zoom in to where the routing is failing, to see and determine that the Time Interval or Destination Point is not right or too close at the complex land - sea interface. Then change the Time Interval or move the Destination Point further out to sea where the routing calculations can be made more easily. This is just one configuration consideration, there are others. Here is a good example of “Avoidance Routing” around Irma. The polars could be made more conservative (and should be), and the routing will probably “fail” which would be a warning that a better “weather window” is needed.

Each line describes the curve for one windspeed, ws. Optionally, the first line may begin with the string \"pol\", in which case it is treated as a comment line. This klunky format is not my idea; it is for compatibility with Expedition and other software tools, and because it loads easily into spreadsheet tools such as Excel. Each curve is described on one line of the text file by a windspeed, followed by a sequence of pairs of True Wind Angle and boatspeed. (TWA in degrees, BSP in knots) eg: 10 30 0 45 6 90 8.1 160 7 180 5 15 30 0 40 8 90 12 150 10 165 9 170 5 This gives two curves, one for windspeed 10, one for windspeed 15. Different curves may have different TWA points, and different numbers of points. The line for windspeed 10 specifies a boatspeed of zero knots at a true wind angle of 30 degrees, a boatspeed of six knots at TWA 45, 8.1 knots at 90, seven knots at 160 degrees, and five knots at 180 degrees. There can be a zero windspeed curve with non-zero boatspeed, i.e., “when the wind is gone, the motor’s on.” Rules for the data in polar files: One windspeed curve per line. There must be a least 3 points per curve. There must be at least one non-zero windspeed curve. The minimum TWA is zero, and the maximum is 180. The 2nd smallest TWA in a line is the best VMG upwind angle for that windspeed. The 2nd largest TWA is the best VMG downwind angle for that The first TWA should be less than any 2nd TWA in any curve. Ideally, zero. The last TWA should be greater than any 2nd-to-last TWA in any curve. Ideally, 180 If these rules are broken, the behavior of the program is undetermined. 2 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52 56 60 64 68 72 76 80 84 88 92 96 100 104 108 112 116 120 124 128 132 136 140 144 148 152 156 160 164 168 172 176 180 4 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52 56 60 64 68 72 76 80 84 88 92 96 100 104 108 112 116 120 124 128 132 136 140 144 148 152 156 160 164 168 172 176 18 6 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52 __4.5__ 56 60 __5__ 64 68 72 76 __5.5__ 80 84 88 92 __5.7__ 96 100 104 108 112 __5.8__ 116 120 __5.5__ 124 128 132 136 __4.8__ 140 144 148 152 __4__ 156 160 164 168 172 176 180 8 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52 __5.4__ 56 60 __6__ 64 68 72 76 __6.4__ 80 84 88 92 __6.6__ 96 100 104 108 112__ 6.7__ 116 120 __6.5__ 124 128 132 136 __6__ 140 144 148 152 __5__ 156 160 164 168 172 176 180 10 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52 __6.1__ 56 60 __6.5__ 64 68 72 76 __6.8__ 80 84 88 92__ 7__ 96 100 104 108 112 __7.1__ 116 120 7 124 128 132 136 __6.6__ 140 144 148 152 __5.9__ 156 160 164 168 172 176 180 12 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52 6.4 56 60 6.7 64 68 72 76__ 7__ 80 84 88 92 __7.3__ 96 100 104 108 112 __7.4__ 116 120 7.3 124 128 132 136 7 140 144 148 152 __6.5__ 156 160 164 168 172 176 180 14 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52 6.8 56 60 6.8 64 68 72 76 7.2 80 84 88 92 7.5 96 100 104 108 112 7.6 116 120 7.6 124 128 132 136 7.4 140 144 148 152 6.9 156 160 164 168 172 176 180 16 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52 6.7 56 60 6.9 64 68 72 76 7.3 80 84 88 92 7.6 96 100 104 108 112 7.7 116 120 7.9 124 128 132 136 7.7 140 144 148 152 7.3 156 160 164 168 172 176 180 18 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52 56 60 64 68 72 76 80 84 88 92 96 100 104 108 112 116 120 124 128 132 136 140 144 148 152 156 160 164 168 172 176 180 20 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52 6.7 56 60 7 64 68 72 76 7.4 80 84 88 92 7.7 96 100 104 108 112 7.9 116 120 8.2 124 128 132 136 8.3 140 144 148 152 7.9 156 160 164 168 172 176 180 22 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52 56 60 64 68 72 76 80 84 88 92 96 100 104 108 112 116 120 124 128 132 136 140 144 148 152 156 160 164 168 172 176 180 24 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52 56 60 64 68 72 76 80 84 88 92 96 100 104 108 112 116 120 124 128 132 136 140 144 148 152 156 160 164 168 172 176 180 26 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52 56 60 64 68 72 76 80 84 88 92 96 100 104 108 112 116 120 124 128 132 136 140 144 148 152 156 160 164 168 172 176 180 28 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52 56 60 64 68 72 76 80 84 88 92 96 100 104 108 112 116 120 124 128 132 136 140 144 148 152 156 160 164 168 172 176 180 30 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52 56 60 64 68 72 76 80 84 88 92 96 100 104 108 112 116 120 124 128 132 136 140 144 148 152 156 160 164 168 172 176 180 32 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52 56 60 64 68 72 76 80 84 88 92 96 100 104 108 112 116 120 124 128 132 136 140 144 148 152 156 160 164 168 172 176 180 34 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52 56 60 64 68 72 76 80 84 88 92 96 100 104 108 112 116 120 124 128 132 136 140 144 148 152 156 160 164 168 172 176 180 36 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52 56 60 64 68 72 76 80 84 88 92 96 100 104 108 112 116 120 124 128 132 136 140 144 148 152 156 160 164 168 172 176 180","title":"Polar File Conversion","component":"weather_routing","version":"","name":"polar_file_conversion","url":"/weather_routing/polar_file_conversion.html","titles":[{"text":"Weather_routing_pi and Polar Formats","hash":"_weather_routing_pi_and_polar_formats","id":1},{"text":"Plot Details Tab","hash":"_plot_details_tab","id":2},{"text":"OpenCPN <boat>.xml File  (Boat-Climatology.xml)","hash":"_opencpn_boat_xml_file_boat_climatology_xml","id":3},{"text":"OpenCPN <polar.pol (Example-0-10.pol)","hash":"_opencpn_polar_pol_example_0_10_pol","id":4},{"text":"qtVLM Polar Format","hash":"_qtvlm_polar_format","id":5},{"text":"Maxsea Polar Format (same as Adrena, or SailGrib WR)","hash":"_maxsea_polar_format_same_as_adrena_or_sailgrib_wr","id":6},{"text":"Bluewater Racing, and Expedition Polar file format","hash":"_bluewater_racing_and_expedition_polar_file_format","id":7},{"text":"Bluewater Racing Example (and Expedition)","hash":"_bluewater_racing_example_and_expedition","id":8}]},"222":{"id":222,"text":"Developer: Jon Gough Sources: https://github.com/jongough/windvane_pi Releases: https://github.com/jongough/windvane_pi/releases Download: https://opencpn.org/OpenCPN/plugins/windvane.html Forum: Windvane Thread This plugin is for those that have older style auto pilots that have simplistic inputs/outputs and whose yachts are not suitable for normal windvane autopilots. This plugin uses the wind instruments that OpenCPN can see, i.e. the ones that allow the display of wind direction and speed, to control the standard autopilot. This is done by using the APB and RMB NMEA 0183 sentences. In this case the plugin creates new versions of the sentences with a prefix of “WV” so that it can be easily used. When this plugin is installed both the WVAPB and WVRMB sentences will be produced irrespective of whether the plugin is being used. If the plugin is not being used the APB and RMB sentences are the same as normally generated, but if the plugin is being used then the APB and RMB sentences are modified to make the autopilot follow the wind changes. This makes the setup of the connections filtering easier. Install and Enable these plugins now: Instructions When the plugin is enabled it will show, in the OpenCPN toolbar. This tool will not activate unless there is wind, gps and heading information being provided to OpenCPN. You will get a warning dialog: If there is wind, gps and heading information being supplied you will activate the main autopilot dialog: 'This will show you the current 'aggresiveness' to follow the required Angle by modifying the amount of virtual XTE is being sent to the autopilot and the 'sensitivity' to variations in wind direction. These sliders are used to control how much rudder to put in when the wind direction is not as required and how many seconds to average the wind direction over. The dial part of the diagram shows the Smoothed Wind Angle (SWA) as a number and graphically as the brown pointer. It shows the current Apparent Wind Angle (AWA) as a number and graphically as a blue pointer. The final item is the yellow 'bug'. This is used to set the desired wind angle. When the WV icon is pressed the bug is set to the current wind angle. If this angle needs to be changed it can be dragged with the left mouse button held down. The number in the middle of the dial shows the numeric number of degrees from straight ahead that the bug is set too. It should be very easy to use, although it may take a little trial and error to get the Angle/XTE and Sensitivity settings correct for your yacht. Each sailing day is different so the settings may/will need adjusting for the current conditions to get the desired result. Clicking on the WV icon in the OpenCPN tool bar when the dialog is shown will turn off the autopilot and the normal route following messages will start to flow to the autopilot. There are two items that have to be setup to make this work The filtering of the messages from OpenCPN to the autopilot. You will need to filter the 'ECAPB' and 'ECRMB' messages so that they do not get transmitted. You need to ensure the 'WVAPB' and 'WVRMB' messages are being sent instead. The default setting to use for the plugin. These are setup in the Windvane Preferences. This is the default time between sending messages to the autopilot. If your autopilot wants them every 5 seconds there is no point in sending these every second, it just slows the whole system down. So this setting is dependent on the way your autopilot works. This sets the length of the slider in the active Windvane Autopilot dialog. This may take a bit of trial and error to determine what works best for your yacht. The higher the number the more aggressively the plugin will get in telling your autopilot how far off course you are. Autopilots often ignore small XTE errors and only start to modify direction when they get past a certain, internal limit. They will have algorithms that determine how aggressively to keep on a given route. This setting allows the plugin to handle the depending on conditions. This sets the maximum time over which to smooth the wind direction. This normally needs to be set to a sufficient time to allow for wave/swell action and boat reaction to wind changes. If the number is too big it makes setting the correct value on the Windvane Autopilot dialog more difficult as the slider will only need to be moved a very small distance to change values.","title":"Windvane
